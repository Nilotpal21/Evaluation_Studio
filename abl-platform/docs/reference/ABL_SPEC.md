# Agent Blueprint Language (ABL) Specification - Part 8: Agent-Based DSL

## Overview

This specification defines an **agent-based DSL** that compiles to an intermediate representation (AgentIR) executed by the platform runtime. Unlike the step-based approach (which creates dialog flows), this DSL defines agents that reason about goals, use tools intelligently, and manage complex workflows.

### Implementation Status Legend

Features in this spec are marked with their implementation status:

- No mark — **Fully implemented** and production-ready
- ⚡ — **Partial implementation** — core functionality works but some sub-features are pending
- 🗺️ — **Roadmap** — type definitions exist but runtime execution is not yet implemented

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Step-Based vs Agent-Based

| Aspect       | Step-Based (Current)    | Agent-Based (New)        |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Flow Control | Explicit numbered steps | Goal-driven reasoning    |
| Transitions  | `ON_SUCCESS -> 5`       | LLM decides next action  |
| Responses    | Template strings        | LLM-generated contextual |
| Tool Usage   | Scripted calls          | Agent decides when/what  |
| Flexibility  | Rigid, predictable      | Adaptive, intelligent    |

### 1.2 Core Principles

1. **Goal-Oriented**: Agents work toward defined goals, not through scripts
2. **Constraint-Guarded**: Business rules enforced via constraints, not step order
3. **Memory-Enabled**: Agents remember user preferences across sessions
4. **Composable**: Agents can delegate to sub-agents or handoff entirely
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Clear escalation paths when needed

### 1.3 Reasoning vs Flow: When to Use Each

ABL supports two execution styles, derived from the presence or absence of a `FLOW:` section:

|                   | Reasoning (No FLOW)                                                         | Flow (With FLOW)                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **How it works**  | LLM reasons about goals, calls tools, collects info conversationally        | Deterministic state machine with explicit step transitions                         |
| **Best for**      | Most agents — customer support, search, recommendations, general assistance | Strict compliance workflows, cost-sensitive high-volume flows, auditable processes |
| **Flexibility**   | Handles edge cases, multi-topic conversations, unexpected inputs naturally  | Rigid — only handles paths you've defined                                          |
| **Cost**          | Higher per-turn (LLM call each turn)                                        | Lower per-turn (no LLM call on deterministic steps)                                |
| **Design effort** | Low — define GOAL, TOOLS, CONSTRAINTS and the LLM figures out the rest      | High — must anticipate every path, define every step                               |

> **Recommended default**: Start with **reasoning mode** (no FLOW). Most agents do not need a scripted flow. Add FLOW only when you have a well-defined deterministic process that benefits from strict step ordering, cost reduction, or regulatory auditability.

---

## 2. Document Structure

```
AGENT: <name>

# Identity
GOAL: <string or multiline block>
PERSONA: <multiline string>
LIMITATIONS: <list>

# Capabilities
TOOLS: <tool definitions>
GATHER: <information requirements>

# State Management
MEMORY:
  session: <list>
  persistent: <list>
  remember: <triggers>
  recall: <retrieval rules>

# Business Rules
CONSTRAINTS:
  <phase>:
    - REQUIRE <condition>
      ON_FAIL: <response template>
GUARDRAILS: <input/output safety checks>

# Multi-Format Output
TEMPLATES: <named templates with channel-specific formats>

# Context-Dependent Behavior (standalone documents)
# BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: <name>  — defined in separate .behavior_profile.abl files
# Referenced via USE BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: <name> in agent documents

# Flow Control
FLOW: <optional deterministic step sequence>
DELEGATE: <sub-agent calls>
HANDOFF: <agent transfers>
ESCALATE: <human escalation>
COMPLETE: <completion conditions>

# Error Handling
ON_ERROR: <error handlers>

# Lifecycle & Configuration
EXECUTION: <model, timeouts, iteration limits>
HOOKS: <before_turn, after_turn lifecycle handlers>
ON_START: <initial actions when agent activates>
ACTION_HANDLERS: <interactive UI button/action definitions>
```

> **Dual Format Support**: ABL supports both the traditional uppercase keyword format (`.agent.abl`) and a YAML-based format (`.agent.yaml`). The `.abl` format requires **uppercase keywords** (`AGENT:`, `GOAL:`, `TOOLS:`). The `.yaml` format uses **lowercase keywords** (`agent:`, `goal:`, `tools:`). Keywords are NOT interchangeable between formats — using `agent:` in a `.abl` file will produce a parser error. See the [DSL Extensions](DSL_EXTENSIONS.md) for YAML format details.

`GOAL:` may be a single quoted string or a multiline block (`GOAL: |`) when the objective needs multiple clauses. Keep the goal declarative: describe the outcome the agent is optimizing for, not step-by-step control flow.

---

## 3. Section Specifications

### 3.1 AGENT Declaration

```
AGENT: <PascalCase_Name>
```

**Rules:**

- Must be unique within the system
- PascalCase with underscores allowed
- Maps to `metadata.name` in the compiled AgentIR

**Examples:**

```
AGENT: Hotel_Search
AGENT: Payment_Processor
AGENT: Customer_Support
```

---

### 3.2 GOAL

Defines what the agent is trying to achieve. Used in system prompt and for completion detection.

```
GOAL: "<imperative statement describing the agent's purpose>"
```

**Rules:**

- Must be a clear, achievable objective
- Should be measurable (agent can determine when done)
- Injected into LLM system prompt

**Examples:**

```
GOAL: "Help user find and book a hotel that meets all booking policies"
GOAL: "Process user's refund request and confirm resolution"
GOAL: "Collect issue details and route to appropriate support team"
```

---

### 3.3 PERSONA

Multi-line description of agent's personality and behavior. Directly injected into system prompt.

```
PERSONA: |
  <line 1>
  <line 2>
  ...
```

**Rules:**

- Use YAML multi-line syntax (`|`)
- Describe tone, style, approach
- Can reference memory (e.g., "References user's past preferences")

**Example:**

```
PERSONA: |
  Helpful, knowledgeable hotel booking specialist.
  Friendly but efficient - doesn't waste user's time.
  Asks clarifying questions only when necessary.
  Always explains why if a booking can't be made.
  References user's past preferences when making suggestions.
```

---

### 3.4 LIMITATIONS

Prompt-level boundaries that guide how the agent should respond. Injected into the system prompt; use `CONSTRAINTS` for deterministic runtime checks.

```
LIMITATIONS:
  - "<limitation 1>"
  - "<limitation 2>"
```

**Rules:**

- Clear statements of what's NOT possible
- Helps the LLM explain scope or decline inappropriate requests
- Should match actual system capabilities

**Example:**

```
LIMITATIONS:
  - "Cannot guarantee room availability until booking is confirmed"
  - "Cannot override blackout dates or minimum stay policies"
  - "Cannot process payments directly - must handoff to Payment agent"
  - "Cannot access bookings made outside this system"
```

---

### 3.5 TOOLS

Defines tools the agent can use. Compiles to `ToolDefinition` entries in the AgentIR.

```
TOOLS:
  <tool_name>(<params>) -> <return_type>
  ...
```

**Parameter Syntax:**

```
param_name: type [= default]
```

**Supported Types:**

- `string` - Text value
- `number` - Numeric value (int or float)
- `boolean` - True/false
- `date` - Date value (ISO 8601 or natural language)
- `array` - List of values
- `object` - Structured object
- `Hotel[]` - Array of typed objects
- `{field: type, ...}` - Inline object type

**Examples:**

```
TOOLS:
  # Simple tool with typed return
  check_blackout_dates(destination: string, checkin: date, checkout: date) -> {allowed: boolean, reason?: string}

  # Tool with default parameter
  search_hotels(destination: string, checkin: date, checkout: date, guests: number = 2) -> Hotel[]

  # Tool with complex return
  get_hotel_details(hotel_id: string) -> {
    name: string,
    rating: number,
    amenities: string[],
    rooms_available: number,
    price_per_night: number
  }

  # Action tool (no meaningful return)
  create_reservation(hotel_id: string, guest_info: GuestInfo) -> Reservation
```

> **Tool implementation note**: Agent `TOOLS:` declarations define the callable contract. The HTTP implementation stored in the Tool Library (`.tools.abl`) may use either `body: |` for a static payload or `body_template: |` for a templated payload that resolves runtime values such as `{{session.idCard}}` or `{{env.API_BASE_URL}}`.

> **Import/apply note**: During project bundle import, inline agent `TOOLS:` signatures are previewed as tool additions and `apply` auto-creates project tool stubs when no companion `.tools.abl` file exists in the bundle. The next export materializes those synthesized stubs under `tools/<name>.tools.abl`. Outside bundle import, referenced tools still need to exist in the project tool registry before compilation/runtime use.

#### Tool Auth Properties

Tools that access external services can declare auth requirements using indented sub-properties. These compile to fields on `ToolDefinition` in the AgentIR and are consumed by the runtime auth middleware.

```
TOOLS:
  gmail_lookup(query: string) -> Result
    auth_profile: "google-creds"
    auth_jit: true
    consent: preflight
    connection: per_user
    description: "Look up Gmail messages"
```

| Property       | IR Field           | Type                      | Description                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth_profile` | `auth_profile_ref` | `string`                  | Reference to an auth profile by name or config variable (e.g. `"{{config.GOOGLE_AUTH}}"`) |
| `auth_jit`     | `jit_auth`         | `boolean`                 | Whether this tool requires just-in-time authentication                                    |
| `consent`      | `consent_mode`     | `'preflight' \| 'inline'` | `preflight` prompts for all auth upfront; `inline` prompts on first tool use              |
| `connection`   | `connection_mode`  | `'per_user' \| 'shared'`  | `per_user` requires user-scoped credentials; `shared` uses tenant-level                   |

**Rules:**

- `auth_jit: true` without `auth_profile` emits warning `AUTH_JIT_WITHOUT_PROFILE`
- `consent` without `auth_profile` is ignored (orphan consent)
- Templated refs (`"{{config.X}}"`) are preserved verbatim for runtime name resolution
- When multiple tools reference the same `auth_profile`, requirements are merged: scopes are unioned, `preflight` wins over `inline`, `per_user` wins over `shared`

After compilation, the runtime collects all auth requirements via `collectAuthRequirements()` into `AuthRequirementIR[]` for preflight consent checks and credential resolution.

#### Tool Confirmation Properties

Tools that can mutate external state should declare confirmation behavior explicitly instead of relying on an implicit runtime default.

```dsl
TOOLS:
  charge_card(amount: number) -> Result
    description: "Charge the customer's card"
    side_effects: true
    confirm: when_side_effects
    immutable: [amount]
```

| Property    | IR Field                        | Type                                         | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `confirm`   | `confirmation.require`          | `'always' \| 'never' \| 'when_side_effects'` | When to require user approval before the tool executes                 |
| `immutable` | `confirmation.immutable_params` | `string[]`                                   | Parameters locked after approval so the execution payload cannot drift |

- The compiler emits warning `SIDE_EFFECT_TOOL_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` when `side_effects: true` is set without an explicit `confirm` policy.
- The runtime does **not** auto-default confirmation behavior. Choose `confirm: when_side_effects`, `confirm: always`, or `confirm: never` deliberately for each side-effecting tool.

---

#### 3.5.1 ENTITIES (Named Entity Registry)

`ENTITIES:` defines reusable extraction contracts that `GATHER` fields can reference with `ENTITY_REF`. Use it when several fields or agents need the same enum, synonym set, or pattern validation.

```dsl
ENTITIES:
  request_type:
    TYPE: enum
    VALUES: [REQ_REFUND, REQ_EXCHANGE, REQ_CANCEL]
    SYNONYMS:
      REQ_REFUND: [refund, money back, reimburse]
      REQ_EXCHANGE: [exchange, swap]
      REQ_CANCEL: [cancel, cancellation]

  booking_ref:
    TYPE: pattern
    PATTERN: "^[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4,6}$"

GATHER:
  request:
    ENTITY_REF: request_type
    PROMPT: "What type of request do you have?"
```

| Property            | Applies To            | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TYPE`              | all                   | `enum` or `pattern`.                                                                       |
| `VALUES`            | `enum`                | Canonical values stored in session state.                                                  |
| `SYNONYMS`          | `enum`                | User-facing phrases mapped to each canonical value.                                        |
| `PATTERN`           | `pattern`             | Regex used to validate extracted values.                                                   |
| `SENSITIVE`         | `enum`, `pattern`     | Marks values as personal or regulated data when referenced by gather fields.               |
| `SENSITIVE_DISPLAY` | sensitive definitions | `redact`, `replace`, or `mask`; follows the same renderer rules as gather privacy fields.  |
| `MASK_CONFIG`       | `mask` mode           | Optional `show_first`, `show_last`, and `char` configuration.                              |
| `PII_TYPE`          | `mask` mode           | Shape hint such as `email`, `phone`, `ssn`, `credit_card`, `address`, `name`, or `custom`. |

**Rules:**

- `ENTITY_REF` must point to an entity declared in `ENTITIES:`.
- A `GATHER` field with `ENTITY_REF` should not also declare `TYPE`, `OPTIONS`, or `VALUES`; the referenced entity owns that contract.
- Entity definitions compile into `AgentIR.entities`; gather fields keep the reference so runtime extraction, validation, and UI surfaces can resolve the canonical definition.
- Privacy fields on an entity follow the same sensitive rendering behavior as `GATHER` privacy attributes.

---

#### 3.5.2 LOOKUP_TABLES (Reference Data)

`LOOKUP_TABLES:` defines lookup-backed reference sets for validation, normalization, and suggestions. Agent-local lookup tables are supported but experimental; project runtime config lookup tables are the canonical shared source for production reference data.

```dsl
LOOKUP_TABLES:
  airports:
    source: inline
    values: [LAX, JFK, CDG, LHR]
    case_sensitive: false
    fuzzy_match: true
    fuzzy_threshold: 0.85

  hotels:
    source: collection
    table_name: lookup_hotels
    field: name
```

| Field             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source`          | `inline`, `collection`, or `api`.                            |
| `values`          | Inline value list when `source: inline`.                     |
| `table_name`      | Collection/runtime-config table name for shared lookup data. |
| `field`           | Field to read from collection-backed rows.                   |
| `case_sensitive`  | Whether matching preserves case.                             |
| `fuzzy_match`     | Enables approximate matching.                                |
| `fuzzy_threshold` | Similarity threshold for fuzzy matching.                     |

- Use `GATHER` field semantics to reference a lookup table from a field.
- Agent-local tables compile into `AgentIR.lookup_tables` and emit an experimental warning.
- Prefer project runtime config lookup tables when multiple agents share the same reference set.

---

#### 3.5.3 NLU, INTENTS, MULTI_INTENT, MESSAGES, and TESTS

These top-level sections are parsed for compatibility with authored and imported agents. Runtime support varies by section; prefer the current `HANDOFF`, `GATHER`, `DIGRESSIONS`, and `GUARDRAILS` constructs for new behavior unless the section below names a wired runtime contract.

```dsl
NLU:
  entities:
    - NAME: ssn
      TYPE: pattern
      PATTERN: "\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}"
      SENSITIVE: true

INTENTS:
  LEXICAL_FALLBACK: when_unavailable
  location_lookup: "Help users find a nearby service location"

MULTI_INTENT:
  strategy: primary_queue
  max_intents: 5
  confidence_threshold: 0.7
  enabled: true

MESSAGES:
  error_default: "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again."
  escalation_notice: TEMPLATE(escalation_notice)

TESTS:
  - name: "happy path"
    input: "track my order"
    expect_intent: order_inquiry
```

| Section        | Runtime contract                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NLU`          | Defines entity extraction metadata. Prefer `ENTITIES` for reusable field contracts in new agents. |
| `INTENTS`      | Declares intent labels and lexical fallback behavior for routing/classification.                  |
| `MULTI_INTENT` | Configures multi-intent detection strategy when the runtime classifier supports it.               |
| `MESSAGES`     | Overrides named runtime/user-facing message strings; values may reference `TEMPLATE(name)`.       |
| `TESTS`        | Authoring/evaluation metadata. Parsed for tooling; not a runtime execution section.               |
| `INSTRUCTIONS` | Additional authoring instructions merged with persona/behavior-profile guidance where supported.  |

### 3.6 GATHER

Defines information the agent needs to collect. Agent will intelligently gather these through conversation.

```
GATHER:
  <field_name>:
    prompt: "<question to ask if not provided>"
    type: <type>
    required: <boolean>
    default: <value>
    validate: "<validation rule>"
```

**Rules:**

- Agent will ask for required fields not yet provided
- Agent extracts from user messages (doesn't always ask directly)
- Validation rules checked before proceeding

**Example — GATHER in a reasoning agent (no FLOW):**

In reasoning mode, GATHER fields are collected conversationally. The LLM uses the prompts as guidance but asks naturally based on conversation context — it may collect multiple fields in a single turn if the user volunteers information.

```dsl
AGENT: Refund_Agent

GOAL: "Help customers process refunds for eligible orders"

TOOLS:
  lookup_order(order_id: string) -> {order_id: string, items: object[], total: number, status: string}
    description: "Look up order details"
  process_refund(order_id: string, item_id: string, reason: string) -> {refund_id: string, amount: number}
    description: "Process refund for an item"

GATHER:
  order_id:
    prompt: "Could you share your order number?"
    type: string
    required: true
  refund_reason:
    prompt: "What's the reason for the refund?"
    type: string
    required: true
    validate: "Must describe a specific issue"

CONSTRAINTS:
  - REQUIRE lookup_order.status != "already_refunded"
    ON_FAIL: "This order has already been refunded."

COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: refund_id IS SET
    RESPOND: "Your refund of {{process_refund.amount}} has been processed. Reference: {{refund_id}}"
```

> In this reasoning agent, the LLM decides when to ask for each field, when to call `lookup_order`, and when to call `process_refund` — all guided by the GOAL and CONSTRAINTS. No FLOW section is needed.

**Example — GATHER field definitions (standalone):**

```
GATHER:
  destination:
    prompt: "Where would you like to stay?"
    type: string
    required: true
    validate: "Must be a valid city name"

  checkin:
    prompt: "What's your check-in date?"
    type: date
    required: true
    validate: "Must be today or future date"

  checkout:
    prompt: "What's your check-out date?"
    type: date
    required: true
    validate: "Must be after check-in date"

  guests:
    prompt: "How many guests will be staying?"
    type: number
    required: false
    default: 2
    validate: "Must be between 1 and 10"

  room_preference:
    prompt: "Any room preferences? (king bed, ocean view, etc.)"
    type: string
    required: false
```

#### Extraction Strategies

The `strategy` field controls how the runtime extracts field values from user messages. Three strategies are currently supported:

| Strategy  | Description                                                  | Use When                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pattern` | Regex and JS library extraction only (no LLM calls)          | High-volume, low-cost — dates, phones, emails |
| `llm`     | LLM-based extraction with tool-use                           | Complex fields — addresses, preferences       |
| `hybrid`  | Pattern extraction first, LLM fallback for unresolved fields | Balance of cost and accuracy                  |

> **Roadmap:** `auto` (runtime selects best tier automatically) and `ml` (ML sidecar/NLU engine extraction) are planned but not yet implemented.

> **Note:** The `strategy` field is only effective inside FLOW GATHER blocks (see [§3.20.2](#3202-gather-within-flow-steps)). In top-level GATHER, the runtime always uses LLM-based extraction; specifying `strategy` at the top level is accepted but has no effect.

```dsl
FLOW:
  collect_info:
    REASONING: false
    GATHER:
      - phone: required
      - destination:
          TYPE: string
          REQUIRED: true
      STRATEGY: hybrid   # Try patterns first, LLM fallback
    THEN: next_step
```

#### Field Semantics

The optional `semantics` block provides extraction hints that improve accuracy across all strategies:

| Property     | Description                                                                                     | Example                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `format`     | High-level format hint                                                                          | `airport_code`, `currency_amount`, `address` |
| `components` | Structured sub-parts to extract                                                                 | `[street, city, state, zip, country]`        |
| `unit`       | Unit of measurement                                                                             | `USD`, `kg`, `celsius`                       |
| `lookup`     | Reference table for validation                                                                  | `iata_codes`, `country_names`                |
| `convert_to` | Auto-conversion target unit                                                                     | `USD`, `km`                                  |
| `locale`     | Formatting locale                                                                               | `en-US`, `es-MX`                             |
| `enum_set`   | Allowed enumeration values (alias for top-level `options`; compiler mirrors into `enum_values`) | `[small, medium, large]`                     |

> **Precedence when both `options` and `semantics.enum_set` are specified:** the top-level `options` list wins and is written into `enum_values`. `semantics.enum_set` is retained on the IR `semantics` block for round-trip / introspection but does _not_ override the top-level list.

#### Supported Field Types

ABL provides 6 base storage types plus 25+ semantic type mappings for migration from Kore.ai XO platform:

**Base Types:**

| Type      | Extraction                           | Example Values               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `string`  | LLM or pattern                       | `"Paris"`, `"John Smith"`    |
| `number`  | Regex + JS coercion                  | `42`, `17.5`                 |
| `date`    | JS date library (chrono-node)        | `"2026-03-15"`, `"tomorrow"` |
| `email`   | Regex pattern                        | `"user@example.com"`         |
| `phone`   | Regex + libphonenumber               | `"+1-555-123-4567"`          |
| `boolean` | Keyword matching (yes/no/true/false) | `true`, `false`              |

**Kore Entity Type Mappings** (for XO 10/11 migration):

Kore platform entity types map to ABL's `type` + `semantics` system. For example:

| Kore Entity   | ABL Type | Semantics                                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOC_AIRPORT` | string   | `format: airport_code, lookup: iata_codes`                      |
| `LOC_ADDRESS` | string   | `format: address, components: [street, city, state, zip]`       |
| `CURRENCY`    | number   | `unit: currency, format: currency_amount`                       |
| `PERSON_NAME` | string   | `format: person_name, components: [first, middle, last, title]` |
| `DATE_PERIOD` | string   | `format: date_range, components: [start, end]`                  |
| `PHONE`       | phone    | _(base type)_                                                   |
| `EMAIL`       | email    | _(base type)_                                                   |

> **Full list**: 25+ Kore entity types are mapped. See `packages/compiler/src/platform/utils/kore-entity-map.ts` for the complete mapping.

#### Validation Rules

Fields support typed validation that runs after extraction:

| Type      | Rule Format                     | Example                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pattern` | Regex string                    | `pattern: "^[A-Z]{2}\\d{6}$"` (policy number) |
| `range`   | Numeric range expression        | `range: "1-10"` (guest count)                 |
| `enum`    | Comma-separated allowed values  | `enum: "economy, business, first"`            |
| `custom`  | Expression evaluated at runtime | `custom: "checkout > checkin"`                |
| `llm`     | Natural language instruction    | `llm: "Must be a valid city name"`            |

```dsl
GATHER:
  policy_number:
    prompt: "What is your policy number?"
    type: string
    required: true
    validate:
      type: pattern
      rule: "^POL-[A-Z]{2}\\d{6}$"
      error: "Policy number must be in format POL-XX999999"
      max_retries: 3

  cabin_class:
    prompt: "What class would you like to fly?"
    type: string
    required: true
    validate:
      type: enum
      rule: "economy, premium_economy, business, first"
    infer: true
    infer_confirm: true
```

#### Privacy Attributes

GATHER fields that hold personal or regulated data support four privacy attributes. These attributes control how values are persisted and how they render outside the gather context (confirmation messages, summaries, agent responses, traces).

| Attribute           | Values                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SENSITIVE`         | `true` \| `false`                                                               | Marks the field as sensitive. Required for any of the attributes below to take effect.      |
| `SENSITIVE_DISPLAY` | `redact` \| `replace` \| `mask`                                                 | How the value renders when surfaced outside gather. Default: raw value (no transformation). |
| `MASK_CONFIG`       | `{ show_first, show_last, char }`                                               | Tunes `mask` mode. Defaults: `show_first: 0`, `show_last: 3`, `char: "*"`.                  |
| `PII_TYPE`          | `email` \| `phone` \| `ssn` \| `credit_card` \| `address` \| `name` \| `custom` | Explicit PII-shape hint used by the masker to produce shape-preserving output.              |

**Display modes:**

| Mode      | Behavior                                                             | Example (value `"alice@example.com"`) |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `redact`  | Replace the entire value with `[REDACTED]`                           | `[REDACTED]`                          |
| `replace` | Replace with the uppercased field name in brackets                   | `[EMAIL]`                             |
| `mask`    | Keep `show_first`/`show_last` characters, replace middle with `char` | `****************com`                 |

**`PII_TYPE` — shape-preserving masking:**

`PII_TYPE` is a hint the renderer consults when it chooses how to apply `mask`. It lets non-canonical field names (for example `contact_info`, `customer_number`, `dob`) produce the same shape-aware mask as canonical names would.

The most common case today is `email`: when `pii_type: email` is set and the value contains `@`, the renderer masks only the local part and preserves `@domain`. For other types, the renderer currently falls back to the generic mask; reserving the enum lets future releases introduce type-specific shapes (for example `credit_card` last-4) without a schema change.

```dsl
GATHER:
  contact_info:
    prompt: "What's the best email to reach you?"
    type: string
    required: true
    SENSITIVE: true
    SENSITIVE_DISPLAY: mask
    MASK_CONFIG:
      show_first: 2
      show_last: 0
      char: "*"
    PII_TYPE: email            # value "alice@example.com" → "al***@example.com"

  policy_number:
    prompt: "What is your policy number?"
    type: string
    required: true
    SENSITIVE: true
    SENSITIVE_DISPLAY: mask
    MASK_CONFIG:
      show_first: 0
      show_last: 4
      char: "*"
```

> With default `MASK_CONFIG` (`show_first: 0, show_last: 3`), `PII_TYPE: email` applied to `alice@example.com` produces `**ice@example.com` — the last 3 chars of the local part are preserved and `@domain` is appended. The example above sets `show_first: 2, show_last: 0` to produce the `al***@example.com` shape instead.

**Rules:**

- Privacy attributes apply to **both** top-level `GATHER:` fields and fields inside `FLOW:` step `GATHER:` blocks.
- `SENSITIVE_DISPLAY`, `MASK_CONFIG`, and `PII_TYPE` are ignored when `SENSITIVE: false` or unset — the value renders raw.
- `PII_TYPE` only affects `mask` mode. `redact` and `replace` ignore the hint.
- Unknown `PII_TYPE` values are dropped at parse time; the field falls back to generic masking.
- `renderSensitiveValue` is the canonical redaction point. Surfaces that route values through it (tool-call confirmations, field-inference outputs, and agent responses that template gather fields) honor `SENSITIVE_DISPLAY`. Lower-level trace and observation events currently use a separate hardcoded masker and do not yet consult `SENSITIVE_DISPLAY` or `PII_TYPE` — a follow-up will unify the two paths.

**Migration note:** Existing sensitive fields without `PII_TYPE` continue to work unchanged — the masker falls back to generic `show_first`/`show_last` behavior. Add `PII_TYPE` only when the field name is non-canonical or you need shape-preserving output (email `@domain`, credit-card last-4, etc.).

#### Field Activation Modes

Fields can be conditionally activated based on other collected data:

| Mode             | Behavior                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `required`       | Always prompted (default)                               |
| `optional`       | Collected if mentioned, never prompted                  |
| `progressive`    | Becomes required when `depends_on` fields are collected |
| `{ when: expr }` | Activates when a data-driven condition is true          |

```dsl
GATHER:
  has_loyalty:
    prompt: "Are you a loyalty program member?"
    type: boolean
    required: true

  loyalty_number:
    prompt: "What is your loyalty number?"
    type: string
    activation: progressive
    depends_on: [has_loyalty]

  upgrade_preference:
    prompt: "Would you like to use points for an upgrade?"
    type: boolean
    activation:
      when: "has_loyalty == true AND loyalty_points > 5000"
```

---

### 3.7 MEMORY

Defines what the agent remembers within the current conversation, across one execution tree, and across broader user/project lifecycles.

```
MEMORY:
  session:
    - <variable_name>
    ...

  persistent:
    - PATH: <namespace>.<field>
      SCOPE: user | project | execution_tree
      ACCESS: read | write | readwrite
    ...

  remember:
    - WHEN: <condition>
      STORE: <value> -> <target>
    ...

  recall:
    - ON: <canonical_event>
      ACTION: inject_context | load_memory | prompt_llm
      ...
```

#### 3.7.1 Session Memory

Temporary state within the current conversation. Session memory is projected into reasoning context, tool gating, and prompt shaping before each LLM turn.

```
session:
  - search_results
  - selected_hotel
  - reservation_draft
  - clarification_count
```

#### 3.7.2 Persistent Memory

Durable memory comes in three scopes:

- `user` — facts shared across that user's sessions
- `project` — facts shared across the whole project
- `execution_tree` — workflow-scoped facts shared across one handoff tree or long-running execution

```
persistent:
  - PATH: user.preferred_hotel_chains
    SCOPE: user
    ACCESS: readwrite
  - PATH: project.exchange_rates
    SCOPE: project
    ACCESS: read
  - PATH: workflow.current_quote
    SCOPE: execution_tree
    ACCESS: readwrite
```

Persistent memory entries may also use explicit read/write lists in compatibility-authored agents:

```dsl
persistent:
  READS:
    - user.preferences
  WRITES:
    - workflow.current_quote
```

Session memory declarations can include initial values and reset hints:

```dsl
session:
  - routing_history
  - handoff_count
      INITIAL: 0
      RESET: per_session
```

`ACCESS: readwrite` grants both read and write capability for a persistent path. Prefer the narrowest access that lets the agent complete its job.

> **Reserved system identifiers**: `user_id`, `project_id`, `tenant_id`, and other system-owned context fields are populated by the platform. Treat them as immutable in public ABL authoring.

#### 3.7.3 Remember Triggers

Remember triggers store new information into durable memory when a condition is met.

```
remember:
  - WHEN: booking.confirmed == true
    STORE: {destination, hotel_chain, room_type, price, dates} -> user.past_bookings

  - WHEN: user.mentions_loyalty_program == true
    STORE: {program, tier} -> user.loyalty_programs

  - WHEN: quote_ready == true
    STORE: quoted_price -> workflow.current_quote
```

#### 3.7.4 Recall Instructions

Recall rules load stored facts back into the session at canonical lifecycle events.

```
recall:
  - ON: session:start
    ACTION: inject_context
    PATHS: [user.preferred_hotel_chains, user.loyalty_programs]
  - ON: tool:search_hotels:after
    ACTION: prompt_llm
    INSTRUCTION: "Prefer hotels aligned with the user's known room and loyalty preferences"
  - ON: agent:*:after
    ACTION: load_memory
    DOMAIN: "travel_preferences"
```

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ON`          | yes      | Canonical event name such as `session:start` or `tool:<name>:after`.        |
| `ACTION`      | yes      | `inject_context`, `load_memory`, or `prompt_llm`.                           |
| `PATHS`       | no       | Durable memory paths to retrieve for `inject_context` or `load_memory`.     |
| `DOMAIN`      | no       | Named memory domain used by `load_memory` when paths are domain-scoped.     |
| `INSTRUCTION` | no       | Prompt text used by `prompt_llm` to shape how retrieved context is applied. |

> **Compatibility note**: Retired `ON_<event>` aliases fail with guided diagnostics. Use canonical `ON: session:start`-style event names in new ABL.

---

### 3.8 CONSTRAINTS

Deterministic runtime checks over session state and execution checkpoints. When a check fails, the runtime executes `ON_FAIL`.

```
CONSTRAINTS:
  <label>:
    - REQUIRE|WARN|LIMIT|RESTRICT <condition> [IMPLIES <condition>] [BEFORE calling <tool>|BEFORE returning results]
      WHEN: <condition>                # optional applicability gate
      ON_FAIL: <response or action>
    ...
```

#### 3.8.1 Constraint Labels

Constraint labels are **organizational groupings** for related constraints. All constraints are evaluated every turn in declaration order, regardless of label.

| Label           | Typical authoring use         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `search_rules`  | Search-related checks         |
| `booking_rules` | Booking-related checks        |
| `payment_rules` | Payment-related checks        |
| `always`        | General checks (common label) |

> **Note:** Labels are arbitrary user-defined strings. The compiler flattens all labeled blocks into a single constraint list, and the runtime evaluates them in declaration order every turn. Use labels for readability and organization, not for execution control. Use `WHEN` for contextual gating and structural `BEFORE` only for supported checkpoints.

#### 3.8.2 Condition Syntax

```ebnf
condition = operand comparator operand
          | operand "IS SET"
          | operand "IS NOT SET"
          | "NOT" condition
          | condition "AND" condition
          | condition "OR" condition
          | condition "IMPLIES" condition

constraint_rule = ("REQUIRE" | "WARN" | "LIMIT" | "RESTRICT") condition
                  [before_clause]
                  [when_clause]

before_clause = "BEFORE" checkpoint_target
when_clause = "WHEN:" condition

checkpoint_target = "calling" identifier
                  | "returning results"
```

`IMPLIES` lowers to implication semantics. `LIMIT` and `RESTRICT` are retained as distinct constraint kinds while initially reusing the standard runtime handling path. Non-structural `BEFORE` forms are still accepted for compatibility, but they compile with a warning and have no runtime effect.

#### 3.8.3 ON_FAIL Actions

**Inline form** (single action):

```
ON_FAIL: "<response template with {variables}>"
ON_FAIL: ESCALATE
ON_FAIL: HANDOFF <agent>
ON_FAIL: BLOCK
```

`ON_FAIL: HANDOFF <agent>` is executed through the shared runtime violation handler on the active flow and reasoning paths. In practice, checkpointed failures such as `BEFORE calling ...` and `BEFORE returning results` can perform a real handoff instead of returning a placeholder signal.

**Structured block form** (multiple directives):

When `ON_FAIL:` is followed by an empty value, the parser reads a structured block with these directives:

```
- REQUIRE some_condition
  ON_FAIL:
    RESPOND: "Please provide the required information."
    COLLECT: [field_a, field_b]
    RETRY: true
    GOTO: previous_step
    THEN: continue
```

| Directive | Type     | Description                                             |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RESPOND` | string   | Message shown to the user when the constraint fails     |
| `COLLECT` | string[] | Fields to re-collect (comma-separated list or `[a, b]`) |
| `RETRY`   | boolean  | Whether to retry the current step (`true` / `false`)    |
| `GOTO`    | string   | Jump to a named FLOW step                               |
| `THEN`    | string   | Control flow: `continue`, `retry`, or custom action     |

`CLEAR` is not currently a structured `ON_FAIL` directive for global constraints. If a failed constraint needs to reset variables before retrying, route to a flow step that performs `CLEAR` explicitly.

> **In reasoning mode**: Constraints are runtime checks that the platform evaluates around agent actions. The LLM does not need to remember or simulate them itself — the runtime decides when to respond, block, hand off, escalate, or continue based on the compiled rule set.

**Example:**

```abl
CONSTRAINTS:
  booking_requirements: # label only; runtime gating comes from WHEN / BEFORE
    - REQUIRE selected_hotel IS SET BEFORE calling reserve_hotel
      ON_FAIL: "Pick a hotel before I try to reserve it."

    - REQUIRE user.email IS SET
      WHEN: selected_hotel IS SET
      ON_FAIL: "I'll need your email address to send the confirmation. What's your email?"

    - REQUIRE dispute_type == "card" IMPLIES card_unique_id IS SET
      ON_FAIL: "Card disputes require the card unique ID."

  risk_controls:
    - LIMIT clarification_count < 5
      ON_FAIL: ESCALATE

    - RESTRICT beneficiary_country IN ["CU", "IR", "KP", "SY"]
      ON_FAIL: BLOCK

    - REQUIRE fraud_review_complete == true BEFORE returning results
      ON_FAIL: HANDOFF Fraud_Review_Team
```

---

### 3.9 GUARDRAILS

GUARDRAILS define safety and quality validation rules checked at various execution points. Unlike CONSTRAINTS (which check business logic conditions against session data), GUARDRAILS validate content — user inputs, agent outputs, tool parameters, tool results, and handoff context.

#### Guardrail Kinds

| Kind          | When Evaluated        | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`       | Before LLM processing | Block harmful/malicious user inputs                                         |
| `output`      | After LLM response    | Validate response quality/safety                                            |
| `tool_input`  | Before tool execution | Validate tool parameters                                                    |
| `tool_output` | After tool execution  | Validate tool results                                                       |
| `handoff`     | Before agent handoff  | Validate handoff context                                                    |
| `both`        | Input + Output        | Shorthand — expands to separate input and output guardrails at compile time |

#### 3-Tier Evaluation

Guardrails are evaluated in a tiered architecture for performance:

| Tier              | Method                          | Latency   | Examples                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1: Local** | CEL expressions, regex patterns | <5ms      | Pattern matching, length limits, blocklists |
| **Tier 2: Model** | External classifier APIs        | 10-200ms  | OpenAI Moderation, AWS Bedrock Guardrails   |
| **Tier 3: LLM**   | LLM-as-judge evaluation         | 100-500ms | Semantic checks, tone analysis              |

#### DSL Syntax

```dsl
GUARDRAILS:
  no_pii_output:
    kind: output
    check: "contains_pii(content)"
    action: redact
    msg: "PII detected in response"

  abusive_input_review:
    kind: input
    llm_check: "Does this input contain abusive, threatening, or harassing language?"
    action: block
    msg: "Inappropriate content detected"

  tool_param_validation:
    kind: tool_input
    check: "abl.word_count(tool_input) >= 200"
    action: block
    msg: "Tool input payload is too large"
```

> **`both` expansion**: When `kind: both` is specified, the compiler creates two guardrails — one `input` and one `output` — with identical configuration. This is a convenience for rules that should apply in both directions.

```dsl
GUARDRAILS:
  no_competitor_mentions:
    kind: both
    check: "abl.matches_pattern(input, '(?i)acme travel|globex bookings')"
    action: filter
    msg: "Competitor mention detected"
    # Compiles to two guardrails:
    #   no_competitor_mentions_input (kind: input)
    #   no_competitor_mentions_output (kind: output)
```

> **Important:** Local `check:` expressions are violation predicates: `true` means the guardrail fires and `false` means the content passes. Use documented CEL helpers such as `abl.contains_pii`, `abl.matches_pattern`, `abl.word_count`, `abl.sentence_count`, `abl.contains_url`, and `abl.contains_email`. Tone or safety judgments like empathy/toxicity should use `llm_check` or a provider-backed guardrail rather than undocumented pseudo-check names.

#### Guardrail Fields

| Field       | Required | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`      | yes      | Evaluation point: `input`, `output`, `tool_input`, `tool_output`, `handoff`, or `both`.                           |
| `check`     | no       | Local CEL-style violation predicate. Use for deterministic checks.                                                |
| `llm_check` | no       | Natural-language evaluator instruction for LLM-as-judge checks.                                                   |
| `action`    | yes      | Action to apply when the rule fires. See the action table below.                                                  |
| `msg`       | no       | User-safe message or trace summary associated with the violation. Do not include secrets or internal remediation. |

#### Actions

| Action     | Behavior                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `block`    | Prevent processing, return message                 |
| `warn`     | Log warning, continue processing                   |
| `redact`   | Replace matched content with `[REDACTED]`          |
| `fix`      | Apply an automatic repair strategy                 |
| `reask`    | Ask the model to regenerate                        |
| `filter`   | Remove violating portions while preserving content |
| `escalate` | Route to human agent                               |

> **Implementation Status**: Guardrails are fully implemented in the runtime. Input guardrails are evaluated pre-message, and the runtime filters by `kind` to evaluate guardrails at their respective execution points (tool_input, tool_output, handoff, output). See `GUARDRAILS_SPEC.md` for the full technical specification.

---

### 3.10 DELEGATE

Call a sub-agent for a specific task, get result, continue processing. In reasoning mode, the LLM decides when delegation conditions are met — you don't need to wire delegation into explicit flow steps.

```
DELEGATE:
  - AGENT: <agent_name>
    WHEN: <condition>
    PURPOSE: "<description>"
    INPUT: {<fields to pass>}
    RETURNS: {<expected return fields>}
    USE_RESULT: "<how to use the result>"
```

**Behavior:**

- Current agent pauses
- Sub-agent executes with provided input
- Sub-agent returns result
- Current agent continues with result

**Example:**

```
DELEGATE:
  - AGENT: Loyalty_Lookup
    WHEN: user.mentions_loyalty OR booking.ready
    PURPOSE: "Check loyalty status and available rewards"
    INPUT: {user_id, hotel_chain}
    RETURNS: {loyalty_tier: string, points_balance: number, available_rewards: Reward[]}
    USE_RESULT: "Offer to apply rewards if available and beneficial"

  - AGENT: Price_Optimizer
    WHEN: search_results.count > 0 AND user.flexible_dates == true
    PURPOSE: "Find better prices on nearby dates"
    INPUT: {hotel_id, checkin, checkout, flexibility_days: 3}
    RETURNS: {best_price: number, best_dates: DateRange, savings: number}
    USE_RESULT: "Suggest alternative dates if savings > 15%"

  - AGENT: Availability_Checker
    WHEN: user.selects_hotel
    PURPOSE: "Verify real-time availability"
    INPUT: {hotel_id, room_type, dates}
    RETURNS: {available: boolean, alternative_rooms?: Room[]}
    USE_RESULT: "Proceed with booking or offer alternatives"
```

---

### 3.11 HANDOFF

Transfer control to another machine agent permanently (or until that agent hands back). Use [`ESCALATE`](#312-escalate) for human or system resolution.

```
HANDOFF:
  - TO: <agent_name>
    WHEN: <condition>
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [<fields to pass>]
      summary: "<context summary template>"
    EXPECT_RETURN: <boolean>  # RETURN also accepted
    ON_FAILURE: CONTINUE | ESCALATE | RESPOND "message"  # optional
```

**Parameters:**

- `TO`: Target agent
- `WHEN`: Condition triggering handoff
- `CONTEXT.pass`: Data fields to transfer
- `CONTEXT.summary`: Human-readable summary for target agent
- `EXPECT_RETURN`: If `true`, control can return; if `false`, the transfer is permanent. `RETURN` also parses for backward compatibility.
- `ON_FAILURE`: Optional parent fallback for setup or dispatch failures before the target agent accepts the handoff. Supported actions are `CONTINUE`, `ESCALATE`, and `RESPOND "..."`.

**Runtime behavior when `EXPECT_RETURN: true`:**

When a child agent is invoked with `EXPECT_RETURN: true` (or backward-compatible `RETURN: true`), the runtime automatically injects a `__return_to_parent__` system tool into the child's tool set. This allows the child to explicitly return control to the parent supervisor when it encounters a request outside its capabilities (digression handling). The child's thread is set to `waiting` status (not `completed`), preserving its conversation history and gathered data. If the supervisor later re-routes to the same child agent, the runtime **resumes the existing waiting thread** instead of creating a new one — the child's prior context, gathered fields, and conversation history are fully preserved.

`ON_FAILURE` is phase-aware for handoff. It applies only to parent-owned failures before transfer acceptance, such as target lookup, pre-transfer validation, or dispatch failures. It does **not** replace the separate timeout path after an accepted returnable handoff, and it does **not** retroactively fire when a downstream child agent later reports its own failure.

**Example:**

```
HANDOFF:
  - TO: Payment_Agent
    WHEN: reservation.ready_for_payment == true
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [reservation, selected_hotel, user.loyalty_programs, user.email]
      summary: |
        User booking {selected_hotel.name} in {destination}
        Dates: {checkin} to {checkout} ({nights} nights)
        Total: ${reservation.total}
        Loyalty: {user.loyalty_programs}
    EXPECT_RETURN: false

  - TO: Flight_Search
    WHEN: user.intent == "also_need_flight"
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [destination, checkin, checkout]
      summary: "User also needs flights to {destination}, arriving by {checkin}"
    EXPECT_RETURN: true  # May return after flight is booked

  - TO: Support_Agent
    WHEN: user.intent == "complaint" OR user.sentiment == "frustrated"
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [conversation_history, booking_reference, user.past_bookings]
      summary: |
        User issue: {detected_issue}
        Booking ref: {booking_reference}
        Sentiment: {user.sentiment}
    EXPECT_RETURN: false
```

**Advanced HANDOFF Features:**

**Machine-only targets** — HANDOFF is for machine-to-machine routing only. If a user needs a human or external human queue, use `ESCALATE`.

**History Strategy** — Controls how conversation history is passed to the target agent:

```
HANDOFF:
  - TO: Specialist_Agent
    WHEN: needs_specialist == true
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [user_id, query]
      summary: "User needs specialist help"
      history: auto          # Platform default; usually you can omit this
      # history: none        # Explicit fresh context
      # history: summary_only # Strict summary-only transfer
      # history: full        # Pass full conversation history
      # history:
      #   mode: last_n
      #   count: 5           # Pass only the last 5 messages
```

| Strategy                       | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`                         | Use the handoff summary when available; otherwise pass a bounded recent transcript |
| `none`                         | Target agent starts fresh                                                          |
| `summary_only`                 | Pass only the `summary` field, no message history                                  |
| `full`                         | Pass the complete parent conversation                                              |
| `{ mode: last_n, count: <n> }` | Pass only the last N messages from the parent                                      |

Legacy shorthand `history: last_<n>` is still accepted during the compatibility window, but new authored examples should use the typed `mode` + `count` block.

**Return Handlers & Memory Grants** — Structure what happens after the child returns and expose only the durable memory paths the child actually needs:

```
RETURN_HANDLERS:
  route_to_booking:
    CLEAR: [pending_auth_reason]
    CONTINUE: true

HANDOFF:
  - TO: Authentication_Agent
    WHEN: user.is_authenticated == false
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [session_context]
      summary: "User needs authentication"
      history: auto
      memory_grants:
        - path: workflow.auth_token
          access: readwrite
        - path: user.last_verified_at
          access: read
    EXPECT_RETURN: true
    ON_RETURN:
      handler: route_to_booking
      map:
        user_id: auth_result.user_id
        auth_token: auth_result.token
```

**Async Handoff** — For long-running remote operations with durable suspend/resume:

```
HANDOFF:
  - TO: Background_Processor
    WHEN: needs_processing == true
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [document_id]
      summary: "Process uploaded document"
    ASYNC: true
    TIMEOUT: 300  # 5 minutes
    ON_RETURN:
      action: continue
```

When an async handoff is used, the parent thread is suspended until the remote child completes or times out. Completion and timeout both route back through the same parent coordination contract instead of a separate ad hoc callback path.

`ON_RETURN.action` legal values are `continue` and `resume_intent`. Use `continue` when the parent should resume its current flow after child completion. Use `resume_intent` when the parent should re-run routing against the original user intent with the returned context.

`TIMEOUT` accepts quoted or unquoted duration literals such as `"30s"` and `30s`. Legacy bare numeric seconds remain valid for examples that use plain integers.

**Remote Agent** — Handoff to agents in different services:

```
HANDOFF:
  - TO: External_Service_Agent
    WHEN: needs_external == true
    LOCATION: remote
    ENDPOINT: "https://other-service.example.com/a2a"
    PROTOCOL: a2a
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [query, user_context]
      summary: "Route to external service"
```

`ENDPOINT` is the compiler/runtime source of truth for remote targeting. `LOCATION: remote` is explicit and recommended, though the compiler also treats an `ENDPOINT` without `LOCATION` as remote. Runtime IR stores this as `remote: { location, endpoint, protocol, auth?, timeout? }`. Authentication for remote calls is carried via runtime config / auth-profile resolution into `remote.auth`; there is no raw `auth_header` DSL field in the current runtime contract.

---

### 3.12 ESCALATE

Transfer to human agent with full context.

```
ESCALATE:
  triggers:
    - WHEN: <condition>
      REASON: "<reason for escalation>"
      PRIORITY: low | medium | high | critical
    ...

  context_for_human:
    - <context_item>
    ...

  on_human_complete:
    - IF <condition>: <action>
    ...
```

> **PRIORITY values**: ESCALATE PRIORITY uses string values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` (default: `medium`).

#### 3.12.1 Triggers

```
triggers:
  # Technical failures
  - WHEN: tool_failures > 3
    REASON: "Repeated technical failures"
    PRIORITY: medium

  # Policy issues
  - WHEN: constraint_failures > 2 AND user.sentiment == "frustrated"
    REASON: "User unable to book due to policy restrictions"
    PRIORITY: high

  # High-value transactions
  - WHEN: booking.total > 5000
    REASON: "High-value booking requires human approval"
    PRIORITY: low

  # User request
  - WHEN: user.requests_human == true
    REASON: "User explicitly requested human agent"
    PRIORITY: high

  # Complex situations
  - WHEN: user.has_special_request AND NOT agent.can_handle
    REASON: "Special accommodation request"
    PRIORITY: medium

  # Compliance
  - WHEN: user.mentions_legal OR user.mentions_lawsuit
    REASON: "Potential legal issue"
    PRIORITY: critical
```

#### 3.12.2 Context for Human

```
context_for_human:
  - conversation_transcript
  - extracted_requirements:
      destination: {destination}
      dates: {checkin} to {checkout}
      guests: {guests}
      budget: {user.average_budget}
  - attempted_actions:
      tools_called: {tool_call_history}
      results: {tool_results}
  - failure_reasons: {constraint_failures}
  - user_sentiment: {detected_sentiment}
  - suggested_resolution: "<agent's recommendation>"
  - relevant_policies: {applicable_policies}
```

#### 3.12.3 Post-Human Actions

```
on_human_complete:
  - IF human.resolved == true:
      STORE: {resolution_type, resolution_details} -> user.support_history
      RESPOND: "Thanks for your patience! {human.resolution_summary}"
      COMPLETE: true

  - IF human.handed_back == true:
      CONTINUE: with human.instructions
      CONTEXT: human.additional_context

  - IF human.escalated_further == true:
      RESPOND: "Your case has been escalated to our specialist team. Reference: {case_id}"
      COMPLETE: true
```

---

### 3.13 COMPLETE

Defines when the agent's job is done.

```

For FLOW agents, prefer step-local `COMPLETE_WHEN` and terminal `THEN: COMPLETE` transitions for deterministic flows. Top-level `COMPLETE: WHEN` still works, but it is evaluated against session state outside an individual step and can be surprising when a condition references fields that are only valid during one step.
COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: <condition>
    RESPOND: "<completion message>"
    STORE: <optional memory update>
  ...
```

**Example:**

```
COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: reservation.confirmed == true
    RESPOND: |
      Your reservation is confirmed!
      Confirmation #: {reservation.confirmation_number}
      Hotel: {selected_hotel.name}
      Dates: {checkin} to {checkout}
      Total: ${reservation.total}

      A confirmation email has been sent to {user.email}.
    STORE: {destination, hotel: selected_hotel.name, dates: {checkin, checkout}, price: reservation.total} -> user.past_bookings

  - WHEN: user.intent == "cancel" OR user.intent == "nevermind"
    RESPOND: "No problem! Your search has been saved - just say 'continue my search' anytime to pick up where we left off."
    STORE: {search_state} -> user.saved_searches

  - WHEN: handoff.completed == true
    # Silent completion - handoff agent takes over

  - WHEN: escalate.completed == true
    # Completion handled by escalation flow
```

---

### 3.14 ON_ERROR

Error handling and recovery strategies.

```
ON_ERROR:
  <error_type>:
    RESPOND: "<user message>"
    RETRY: <count>
    THEN: <action>
  ...
```

**Error Types:**

- `tool_timeout` - Tool didn't respond in time
- `tool_error` - Tool returned an error
- `invalid_input` - User input couldn't be parsed
- `validation_error` - Gathered data failed validation
- `api_error` - External API failure
- `unknown_error` - Unexpected error

**Example:**

```
ON_ERROR:
  tool_timeout:
    RESPOND: "I'm having a bit of trouble connecting. Let me try that again..."
    RETRY: 2
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Service unavailable"

  tool_error:
    RESPOND: "Something went wrong. Let me try a different approach."
    RETRY: 1
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Tool error after retry"

  invalid_input:
    RESPOND: "I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?"
    RETRY: 3
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Unable to understand user"

  validation_error:
    RESPOND: "That doesn't seem quite right. Could you double-check?"
    RETRY: 2
    THEN: CONTINUE

  api_error:
    RESPOND: "Our booking system is experiencing issues. Let me connect you with an agent."
    RETRY: 0
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "API failure"

  unknown_error:
    RESPOND: "I apologize, but something unexpected happened. Let me connect you with a team member who can help."
    RETRY: 0
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Unexpected error"
```

> **Note:** `ESCALATE: PRIORITY: <value>` inside ON_ERROR handlers is **not supported** and will be silently dropped. Use `THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "<reason>"` to trigger escalation from error handlers.

#### Step-Level ON_ERROR (FLOW Steps)

FLOW steps support a more detailed ON_ERROR with `- TYPE:` handlers. Each handler accepts additional properties beyond the agent-level `RESPOND`/`RETRY`/`THEN`:

```dsl
FLOW:
  search_flights:
    REASONING: true
    RESPOND: "Searching for flights..."
    ON_ERROR:
      - TYPE: tool_error
        SUBTYPE: timeout
        RESPOND: "The search is taking longer than expected. Retrying..."
        RETRY: 2
        RETRY_DELAY: 3000
        RETRY_BACKOFF: exponential
        THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Search timeout"
      - TYPE: validation_error
        RESPOND: "Let me go back and re-collect your details."
        BACKTRACK_TO: collect_details
    THEN: show_results
```

**Step-Level ON_ERROR Properties:**

| Property        | Type   | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TYPE`          | string | Error type to match (same values as agent-level ON_ERROR)     |
| `SUBTYPE`       | string | Narrower error classification within the type                 |
| `RESPOND`       | string | Message shown to the user                                     |
| `RETRY`         | number | Number of retry attempts                                      |
| `RETRY_DELAY`   | number | Milliseconds to wait before retry                             |
| `RETRY_BACKOFF` | string | Backoff strategy: `exponential`, `linear`, `fixed`            |
| `THEN`          | string | Control flow: `CONTINUE`, `ESCALATE with REASON: "..."`, etc. |
| `BACKTRACK_TO`  | string | Jump to a previous FLOW step instead of continuing            |

### 3.15 TEMPLATES (Named Response Templates)

Templates define reusable response content with channel-specific format variants. Each template has a `DEFAULT` text and optional overrides for specific output channels.

In the current implementation, templates are **compile-time macros**. The compiler resolves exact `TEMPLATE(name)` references before runtime execution. At send time, runtime and channel layers receive resolved `response`, `richContent`, `voiceConfig`, and `actions` objects rather than template names.

**Syntax:**

```
TEMPLATES:
  <template_name>:
    DEFAULT: "<text with {{variable}} interpolation>"
    MARKDOWN: "<markdown formatted variant>"
    HTML: "<html formatted variant>"
    VOICE INSTRUCTIONS: "<instructions for TTS rendering>"
    ADAPTIVE_CARD: "<Adaptive Card JSON>"
    SLACK: "<Slack Block Kit JSON>"
    WHATSAPP: "<WhatsApp message format>"
    AG_UI: "<AG-UI event format>"
```

**Supported Formats:**

| Format               | Channel    | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT`            | All        | Plain text fallback used when no channel-specific format matches |
| `MARKDOWN`           | Web, SDK   | Markdown with tables, headers, bold, lists                       |
| `HTML`               | Web, Email | Full HTML with styling and interactive elements                  |
| `VOICE INSTRUCTIONS` | Voice      | TTS rendering instructions (pacing, emphasis, pauses)            |
| `ADAPTIVE_CARD`      | Teams, Web | Microsoft Adaptive Card JSON schema                              |
| `SLACK`              | Slack      | Slack Block Kit JSON                                             |
| `WHATSAPP`           | WhatsApp   | WhatsApp message template format                                 |
| `AG_UI`              | AG-UI SDK  | AG-UI protocol event stream                                      |

**Variable Interpolation:**

Templates support Handlebars-style interpolation:

- `{{variable}}` — simple value substitution
- `{{#each items}}...{{/each}}` — array iteration
- `{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}` — conditional blocks
- `{{this.field}}` — access fields within iteration context
- `{{value | upper}}`, `{{value | lower}}` — string casing filters
- `{{value | json}}` / `{{value | tojson}}` — JSON render helpers
- `{{timestamp | ago}}` — relative-time formatting for parseable dates

Filtered placeholders fail closed on user-visible surfaces: unsupported filters or unresolved filtered values render as an empty string instead of echoing raw `{{...}}` syntax back to the user.

**Using Templates:**

```
# In flow steps
RESPOND: TEMPLATE(greeting)

# In ON_START
ON_START:
  RESPOND: TEMPLATE(welcome)

# In COMPLETE
COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: order_confirmed == true
    RESPOND: TEMPLATE(checkout_confirmation)
```

**Example — Retail Cart Summary:**

```
TEMPLATES:
  cart_summary:
    DEFAULT: |
      Your Cart:
      {{#each items}}
      - {{this.name}} x{{this.quantity}} — {{this.price}} {{currency}}
      {{/each}}
      Total: {{total}} {{currency}}
    MARKDOWN: |
      ## Your Cart

      | Item | Qty | Price |
      |------|-----|-------|
      {{#each items}}
      | {{this.name}} | {{this.quantity}} | {{this.price}} {{currency}} |
      {{/each}}

      **Total: {{total}} {{currency}}**
    HTML: |
      <div class="cart-summary">
        <h2>Your Cart</h2>
        <table>
          {{#each items}}
          <tr><td>{{this.name}}</td><td>{{this.quantity}}</td><td>{{this.price}} {{currency}}</td></tr>
          {{/each}}
          <tr class="total"><td colspan="2">Total</td><td>{{total}} {{currency}}</td></tr>
        </table>
      </div>
    VOICE INSTRUCTIONS: "Read each item name and price. Then state the total clearly."
```

**Current Resolution Model:**

- The parser stores named templates on the AST.
- The compiler indexes `DEFAULT` text and compiled format variants by template name.
- Exact `TEMPLATE(name)` references are inlined into supported response, prompt, and message locations.
- Unreferenced definitions emit `W602` because they never affect executable output.
- External systems cannot late-resolve named templates from a runtime template registry today.

**Compilation:** Templates compile to `AgentIR.templates: Record<string, string>` for the `DEFAULT` text only. Channel-specific variants are compiled transiently and copied onto the referenced IR node's `rich_content` during template resolution; `VOICE INSTRUCTIONS:` is copied onto the referenced IR node's `voice_config.instructions` when that node does not already define an explicit `VOICE:` block. Template variants are not exposed as a named runtime registry.

#### Planned Extension — `RENDERABLES` (Draft, Not Yet Implemented)

For customer-defined payloads that external systems render themselves, the recommended extension is a `RENDERABLES:` sub-block. This keeps DSL template keys internal while giving API, SDK, and webhook consumers a stable external contract name.

**Draft syntax:**

```abl
TEMPLATES:
  account_summary:
    DEFAULT: "Here is your account summary."
    MARKDOWN: |
      ## Account Summary
      Balance: {{account.balance}} {{account.currency}}
    RENDERABLES:
      - NAME: "com.bank.account_summary.v1"
        TARGETS: ["api", "sdk_websocket", "http_async"]
        FALLBACK_TEXT: "Here is your account summary."
        PAYLOAD_JSON: |
          {
            "accountId": "{{account.id}}",
            "customerName": "{{customer.name}}",
            "balance": "{{account.balance}}",
            "currency": "{{account.currency}}",
            "lastUpdated": "{{account.last_updated}}"
          }

FLOW:
  show_summary:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: TEMPLATE(account_summary)
```

**Planned resolution model for this extension:**

- `account_summary` stays the internal compile-time template key.
- `com.bank.account_summary.v1` becomes the external wire contract name.
- Sync API responses would return `renderables[]` alongside `response`, `richContent`, `voiceConfig`, and `actions`.
- `sdk_websocket` `response_end` would carry the same `renderables[]` array.
- Custom Web SDK renderers would match `message.renderables[].name`.
- `http_async` would include raw `renderables[]` in the webhook payload, rather than requiring consumers to reverse-engineer `channel_output`.

### 3.16 BEHAVIOR_PROFILE (Context-Dependent Behavior)

Behavior profiles allow an agent to adapt its behavior based on runtime context — such as the communication channel, user preferences, or conversation state. Each profile activates conditionally and overrides specific aspects of the agent's base behavior.

> **CRITICAL: Standalone documents only.** Behavior profiles MUST be defined as **standalone `.behavior_profile.abl` files**, NOT inline within agent documents. The parser treats `BEHAVIOR_PROFILE:` as a **document-type keyword** — if it appears inside an `AGENT:` document, it silently overwrites the document kind and consumes all remaining content, destroying the agent definition. The plural form `BEHAVIOR_PROFILES:` is NOT supported and will produce an "Unknown section" parser error.

**Correct pattern — standalone file (`voice-optimized.behavior_profile.abl`):**

```
BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: voice-optimized
PRIORITY: 10
WHEN: context.channel == "voice"
INSTRUCTIONS: "Keep responses under 3 sentences. Use natural speech patterns."
VOICE:
  provider: elevenlabs
  voice_id: aria
  speed: 1.1
RESPONSE_RULES:
  max_buttons: 0
  fallback_format: plain_text
  max_response_length: 200
TOOLS_HIDE: [show_map, render_chart]
CONSTRAINTS:
  - REQUIRE len(response) < 500
    ON_FAIL: "Please provide a shorter response for voice."
GATHER_OVERRIDES:
  validation_style: lenient
  confirmation: always
```

**Referencing profiles from an agent:**

```
AGENT: Hotel_Search
GOAL: "Help user find and book a hotel"

USE BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: voice-optimized
USE BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: sdk-rich
```

**Another standalone profile (`sdk-rich.behavior_profile.abl`):**

```
BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: sdk-rich
PRIORITY: 5
WHEN: context.channel == "sdk" OR context.channel == "web"
RESPONSE_RULES:
  max_buttons: 5
  fallback_format: markdown
  media_types: [image, video, carousel]
TOOLS_ADD:
  - show_carousel(items: object[]) -> {displayed: boolean}
    description: "Display a product carousel in the chat"
```

**Fields:**

| Field                | Type             | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BEHAVIOR_PROFILE`   | string           | Profile name (document-type keyword, must be first line)  |
| `PRIORITY`           | number           | Higher priority wins when multiple profiles match         |
| `WHEN`               | CEL expression   | Activation condition evaluated at runtime                 |
| `INSTRUCTIONS`       | string           | Additional instructions merged with base persona          |
| `VOICE`              | object           | Voice configuration overrides (provider, voice_id, speed) |
| `RESPONSE_RULES`     | object           | Channel-specific response formatting constraints          |
| `TOOLS_HIDE`         | string[]         | Tool names to remove from available tools                 |
| `TOOLS_ADD`          | ToolDefinition[] | Additional tools available only in this profile           |
| `CONSTRAINTS`        | Constraint[]     | Additional constraints active only in this profile        |
| `GATHER_OVERRIDES`   | object           | Modify gather behavior per field                          |
| `FLOW_MODIFICATIONS` | object           | Skip, override, or insert flow steps                      |
| `FLOW_REPLACE`       | string           | Replace the entire base flow with an alternative          |

**Profile Resolution:** At runtime, all profiles whose `WHEN` condition evaluates to `true` are collected and merged by priority (highest wins). Conflicts in the same field are resolved by priority. The merged result is applied on top of the agent's base configuration.

**Compilation:** Profiles compile to `AgentIR.behavior_profiles: BehaviorProfileIR[]`.

---

### 3.17 Voice Configuration

Voice properties control text-to-speech (TTS) rendering when agents operate on voice channels. Voice config can be set at multiple levels: agent-wide, per behavior profile, per template, or per flow step.

> **✅ Implemented:** SSML, `instructions`, and `plain_text` fields are interpolated at runtime and passed to clients. The `provider`, `voice_id`, and `speed` fields are now **resolved from agent IR** via the `voice-config-resolver` module — IR voice config is merged with behavior profile voice overrides (profile takes priority) and applied to TTS sessions. Voice channel transfer via `transfer_to_agent` tool is fully implemented. Per-turn voice config changes are supported when behavior profiles activate mid-session.

**Agent-Level Voice Config:**

```
EXECUTION:
  voice:
    provider: elevenlabs
    voice_id: aria
    speed: 1.0
```

**Per-Template Voice Instructions:**

```
TEMPLATES:
  greeting:
    DEFAULT: "Welcome to our service."
    VOICE INSTRUCTIONS: "Speak warmly with a slight pause after 'Welcome'."
```

**Per-Step Voice Override:**

```
  confirm_booking:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: "Your booking is confirmed."
  VOICE:
    ssml: "<speak><prosody rate='slow'>Your booking is confirmed.</prosody></speak>"
```

**VoiceConfigIR Fields:**

| Field          | Type   | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`     | string | TTS provider (elevenlabs, azure, google, openai)  |
| `voice_id`     | string | Voice identifier from the provider                |
| `speed`        | number | Playback speed multiplier (0.5 - 2.0)             |
| `ssml`         | string | SSML markup for fine-grained speech control       |
| `instructions` | string | Natural language instructions for TTS rendering   |
| `plain_text`   | string | Plain text override (strip formatting before TTS) |

**Voice Channel Agent Transfer:**

Voice channels have special transfer semantics. Unlike chat handoffs, voice transfers involve the telephony gateway:

```
TOOLS:
  transfer_to_agent:
    description: "Transfer call to human agent via telephony gateway"
    params:
      provider: string       # "kore", "genesys", "twilio"
      skills: string[]       # Agent skills required
      queueId: string        # Queue identifier
      priority: number       # Queue priority (1-10)
      postAgentAction: string  # "end" (hang up) or "return" (come back to AI)
      metadata: object       # Channel, department, caller context
    returns: object

# In flow:
transfer_call:
  REASONING: false
  CALL: transfer_to_agent
    WITH:
      provider: "kore"
      skills: ["{{department}}"]
      queueId: "{{department}}_queue"
      priority: 5
      postAgentAction: "end"
  ON_SUCCESS:
    - IF: transfer_to_agent.status == "waiting"
      RESPOND: "Connecting you now. Please hold."
      THEN: complete
```

---

### 3.18 Attachments & File Collection

Agents can collect file attachments from users as part of the GATHER process. Attachment fields support type validation, size limits, and automated processing (OCR, transcription, key frame extraction).

> **⚡ Partial:** Attachment upload, storage, and processing (OCR via Docling, transcription) are fully implemented via the `get_attachment` and `list_attachments` system tools and the multimodal service pipeline. However, the **GATHER-level `AttachmentFieldIR`** with field-specific `ocr_enabled`/`transcription_enabled` flags is **not yet wired** — attachment collection currently works through generic tool calls rather than declarative GATHER fields.

**Top-level syntax:**

```dsl
ATTACHMENTS:
  photo:
    prompt: "Upload a photo"
    category: image
    required: true
    max_size_mb: 5
    allowed_types: [image/jpeg, image/png]
    ocr_enabled: true
```

**Syntax (within GATHER):**

```
GATHER:
  - <field_name>: required
    type: attachment
    category: <image | document | audio | video>
    prompt: "<request message>"
    allowed_mime_types: [<mime_types>]
    max_file_size: <bytes>
    processing:
      ocr_enabled: <boolean>
      transcription_enabled: <boolean>
      key_frame_extraction: <boolean>
```

**Example — Insurance Claim with Photo:**

```
GATHER:
  - damage_photo: required
    type: attachment
    category: image
    prompt: "Please upload a photo of the damage."
    allowed_mime_types: [image/jpeg, image/png, image/heic]
    max_file_size: 10485760  # 10MB
    processing:
      ocr_enabled: true

  - claim_document: optional
    type: attachment
    category: document
    prompt: "If you have a police report or repair estimate, please upload it."
    allowed_mime_types: [application/pdf, image/jpeg]
    max_file_size: 20971520  # 20MB
    processing:
      ocr_enabled: true
```

**Processing Options:**

| Option                  | Applies To      | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ocr_enabled`           | image, document | Extract text from images/PDFs via OCR      |
| `transcription_enabled` | audio, video    | Transcribe speech to text                  |
| `key_frame_extraction`  | video           | Extract representative frames for analysis |

**Compilation:** Attachment fields compile to `AttachmentFieldIR` in the gather section of the AgentIR.

#### DESTINATIONS

`DESTINATIONS:` declares named outbound HTTP targets for attachment routing and other integration workflows. Runtime routing should use a named destination rather than accepting arbitrary inline URLs.

```dsl
DESTINATIONS:
  doc_processor:
    url: "https://api.docprocessor.example/ingest"
    method: POST
    auth: bearer_token
    headers:
      X-Custom: "value"
  archive:
    url: "https://archive.example/upload"
    method: PUT
```

| Field     | Required | Description                                                |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`     | yes      | HTTPS destination URL. Private/internal URLs are rejected. |
| `method`  | no       | HTTP method, usually `POST` or `PUT`.                      |
| `auth`    | no       | Named auth mode/profile reference resolved by runtime.     |
| `headers` | no       | Static headers to include with the routed request.         |

**Compilation:** Destinations compile to `AgentIR.destinations` and are validated for SSRF-sensitive URL shapes at compile/runtime boundaries.

---

### 3.19 Interactive Actions

Agents can include interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, text inputs) in responses. Actions are rendered by the client SDK and trigger handler logic when users interact with them.

> **✅ Implemented:** Interactive actions (BUTTON, SELECT, INPUT) are fully implemented with channel-specific rendering (Slack Block Kit, Teams Adaptive Cards, WhatsApp Interactive, Messenger Quick Replies). The `ACTION_HANDLERS` DSL block is fully implemented — step-level `ON_ACTION` handlers fire first, with agent-level `ACTION_HANDLERS` as fallback when the step has no match. Handlers support `SET`, `CLEAR`, `RESPOND`, `CALL`, `GOTO`/`TRANSITION`/`THEN`, `HANDOFF`, `DELEGATE`, and `COMPLETE`, with condition evaluation for conditional dispatch. Runtime traces include action type, target/tool/step details, forwarded-message source, and terminal success/failure.

**Syntax:**

```
RESPOND: "Choose your preferred option:"
  ACTIONS:
    - BUTTON: "Option A"
      ID: option_a
      VALUE: "a"
    - BUTTON: "Option B"
      ID: option_b
      VALUE: "b"
    - SELECT: "Departure City"
      ID: departure
      OPTIONS:
        - { id: "NYC", label: "New York" }
        - { id: "LAX", label: "Los Angeles" }
        - { id: "ORD", label: "Chicago" }
    - INPUT: "Special requests"
      ID: special_requests
      TYPE: text
      PLACEHOLDER: "Any dietary requirements?"

ACTION_HANDLERS:
  option_a:
    DO:
      - SET: user_choice = "a"
      - RESPOND: "Great choice!"
      - GOTO: process_selection
  option_b:
    DO:
      - SET: user_choice = "b"
      - GOTO: process_selection
  agent_a:
    DO:
      - RESPOND: "Routing to Agent A..."
        FORMATS:
          MARKDOWN: "**Routing to Agent A...**"
      - HANDOFF: Agent_A
```

Handlers may also use the compact direct form:

```
ON_ACTION:
  confirm:
    SET: confirmed = true
    RESPOND: "Confirmed."
    COMPLETE: true
```

Use `DO:` for new authoring when ordering matters or when mixing more than one directive. Terminal actions (`GOTO`, `HANDOFF`, `COMPLETE`, and `DELEGATE` without `RETURN: true`) must be last because later actions are unreachable.

`DO:` is the canonical ordered action-list form for action handlers and canonical digression handlers. The same action ordering rule applies wherever `DO:` appears: non-terminal state/response actions first, terminal control transfer last.

`HANDOFF` and `DELEGATE` targets used from action handlers must be declared in the agent's normal `HANDOFF:` or `DELEGATE:` coordination blocks. For button/select events that arrive with empty text, the runtime forwards the action value, then the action id, as the child message and includes `action_id`, `action_value`, `action_source`, `action_form_data`, and `action_render_id` in the coordination context.

During `ON_ACTION` condition evaluation and handler execution, the current interaction envelope is available as `_action`. It contains `actionId`/`id`, `value`, `source`, `formData`, `form` (an alias for `formData`), and `renderId`. Persist any fields needed after the handler by assigning them explicitly with `SET`; `_action` is scoped to the action turn so later user messages cannot accidentally reuse stale click metadata. SDK, Slack, and Teams action renderers echo the runtime-issued render id so stale or replayed clicks can be rejected against the latest waiting step.

Rich response payloads authored under an action-handler `RESPOND` are delivered in the final `ExecutionResult` for channel dispatch. If a terminal target returns its own rich payload, the terminal target's payload wins; otherwise the handler payload is carried as fallback. The compiler warns when rich or voice content appears before terminal routing so authors can decide whether the payload belongs in the terminal target or a dedicated `GOTO` rendering step.

**Action Element Types:**

| Type     | Fields                                 | Description                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `BUTTON` | id, label, value                       | Clickable button that submits a value |
| `SELECT` | id, label, options[]                   | Dropdown with selectable options      |
| `INPUT`  | id, label, type, placeholder, required | Text/number/date input field          |

**Input Types:** `text`, `number`, `date`, `time`, `email`

**Compilation:** Actions compile to `ActionSetIR` with `ActionElementIR[]` elements. Handlers compile to `ActionHandlerIR[]`.

---

### 3.20 FLOW (Flow-Based Execution)

> **When to use FLOW**: Most agents should use reasoning mode (no FLOW). Add a FLOW section only when you need: strict step ordering for regulatory compliance, deterministic execution for cost-sensitive high-volume flows, or step-by-step auditability. See Section 1.3 for comparison.

> **Execution Style**: Agents with a `FLOW:` section use flow-based execution. Agents without `FLOW:` use reasoning-only execution. The `MODE:` declaration produces a parser error — use per-step `REASONING: true | false` within FLOW steps to enable LLM reasoning on specific steps.

When an agent has a FLOW section, it follows a deterministic state machine defined by the FLOW.

#### Flow Step Execution Order

Within a single flow step, runtime processing follows this order:

| Order | Phase                  | Notes                                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `REASONING`            | Selects deterministic or LLM-assisted handling for this step.                                     |
| 2     | `RESPOND`              | Emits any pre-action response for the step.                                                       |
| 3     | `GATHER`               | Collects required fields for the step, if present.                                                |
| 4     | `CALL`                 | Executes at most one tool call for the step. Use `THEN` to chain additional calls in later steps. |
| 5     | `CHECK`                | Evaluates inline prerequisites after gathered/tool state is available.                            |
| 6     | `ON_RESULT`            | If present after a `CALL`, evaluates result branches first.                                       |
| 7     | `ON_SUCCESS`/`ON_FAIL` | Fallback success/failure handling when `ON_RESULT` does not match or is absent.                   |
| 8     | `ON_INPUT`             | Evaluates after user input for interactive steps; the first matching branch wins.                 |
| 9     | `THEN`                 | Applies the terminal transition when no earlier branch already transitions.                       |

Keep one `CALL` per step. For sequential tool work, split the work into named steps and connect them with `THEN`.

#### 3.20.1 Basic Syntax

> **REASONING is mandatory:** Every FLOW step MUST declare `REASONING: true` or `REASONING: false`. Steps without this declaration produce a parser error: `Step '<name>' must declare REASONING: true or REASONING: false.`

```dsl
FLOW:
  step1 -> step2 -> step3          # Step sequence

  step1:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: "Welcome!"
    THEN: step2

  step2:
    REASONING: true
    GATHER:
      - destination: required
    THEN: step3

  step3:
    REASONING: false
    CALL: search_hotels(destination)
    RESPOND: "Found {{result.total}} hotels!"
    THEN: COMPLETE
```

#### 3.20.2 GATHER within FLOW Steps

FLOW steps can use GATHER for multi-field collection with LLM or pattern-based extraction:

```dsl
FLOW:
  collect_details:
    REASONING: false
    PRESENT: "Let me gather your booking details."
    GATHER:
      - destination: required
      - checkin:
          TYPE: date
          REQUIRED: true
          PROMPT: "When do you want to check in?"
      - checkout:
          TYPE: date
          REQUIRED: true
      - guests:
          TYPE: number
          DEFAULT: 2
      STRATEGY: hybrid
      PROMPT: "Please provide destination, dates, and number of guests."
    CORRECTIONS: true
    COMPLETE_WHEN: destination AND checkin AND checkout
    THEN: search
```

**GATHER Properties:**

- `fields` - List of fields with type, required, default, prompt, validation
- `strategy` - Extraction method: `llm`, `pattern`, or `hybrid`
- `prompt` - Prompt template for collecting
- `VALIDATION:` - Validation rule for the collected value (uppercase keyword)

> **Keyword difference:** Top-level GATHER (§3.6) uses lowercase `validate:` for field validation rules. FLOW GATHER uses uppercase `VALIDATION:` instead. Using the wrong case will cause the property to be silently ignored.

**Advanced GATHER Properties:**

| Property             | Values                                                   | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SEMANTICS`          | Sub-block with `FORMAT`, `LOOKUP`, `COMPONENTS`, `UNIT`  | Supplemental metadata for entity/lookup extraction        |
| `RANGE`              | `true` / `false`                                         | Collect as `{low, high}` range                            |
| `LIST`               | `true` / `false`                                         | Collect as an array                                       |
| `PREFERENCES`        | `true` / `false`                                         | Categorize list values into preference buckets            |
| `ACTIVATION`         | `required`, `optional`, `progressive`, or `{WHEN: expr}` | Controls when the field becomes active                    |
| `DEPENDS_ON`         | `[field1, field2]`                                       | Fields that must be collected first                       |
| `PROMPT_MODE`        | `ask`, `extract_only`                                    | Whether to ask the user or only extract opportunistically |
| `VALIDATION_PROCESS` | `LLM`, `REGEX`, `CODE`                                   | Validation engine for the field                           |
| `RETRY_PROMPT`       | string                                                   | Custom re-prompt after validation failure                 |

When a step declares both `GATHER` and `ON_INPUT`, the gather phase runs first. `ON_INPUT` branches evaluate only after the user has responded to the gather prompt or after the gather phase has enough state to continue. Avoid designing a step that expects the same user message to both satisfy required gather fields and trigger unrelated ON_INPUT routing; split that into separate steps when ordering matters.

Use field-level `validate:` / `VALIDATION:` for checks that are intrinsic to one gathered value (format, range, enum, or extraction confidence). Reserve top-level `CONSTRAINTS` for cross-field, tool-boundary, handoff, or business-rule checks. This keeps gather repair prompts local to the field instead of failing later in unrelated flow logic.

**Step Properties:**

- `PRESENT` - Template shown before collection (can include data from previous steps)
- `CORRECTIONS` - Allow natural corrections like "actually 4 guests not 3"
  - When `CORRECTIONS: true`: If the user says "actually 4 guests", the runtime detects this as a correction to an already-collected field (via regex patterns and LLM fallback), updates the value, and invalidates dependent fields.
  - When `CORRECTIONS: false` (default): The same message is treated as new input for the current step. Use this for:
    - Single-field collection steps (nothing to correct)
    - Strict sequential forms where backtracking is not allowed (e.g., regulatory compliance)
    - Performance-sensitive flows (correction detection adds regex matching and potentially an LLM call)
    - Automated/deterministic pipelines where natural-language corrections don't apply
- `COMPLETE_WHEN` - Condition for when the step is complete

#### 3.20.3 Conditional Branching (ON_INPUT)

```dsl
FLOW:
  confirm:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: "Would you like to proceed?"
    ON_INPUT:
      - IF: input == "yes" OR yes
        RESPOND: "Great! Processing..."
        THEN: process
      - IF: input == "no" OR no
        RESPOND: "No problem."
        THEN: cancelled
      - IF: input contains "change"
        RESPOND: "What would you like to change?"
        THEN: modify
      - ELSE:
        RESPOND: "Please say yes or no."
        THEN: confirm
```

**ON_INPUT Branch Properties:**

- `IF` / `ELSE` - Condition for the branch
- `RESPOND` - Optional response message
- `SET` - Variable assignments (`SET: var = value`)
- `CALL` - Tool call before transition
- `THEN` - Target step

**Common ON_INPUT condition patterns:**

| Pattern  | Example                 | Description                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Equality | `input == "back"`       | Case-insensitive match      |
| Contains | `input contains "help"` | Substring match             |
| Regex    | `input matches /\\d+/`  | Regular expression          |
| Variable | `count >= 5`            | Context variable comparison |
| Keyword  | `yes`, `no`, `back`     | Built-in keyword intent     |

**Built-in intent keywords:**

| Intent   | Keywords                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `back`   | back, go back, previous, return    |
| `cancel` | cancel, nevermind, forget it, stop |
| `change` | change, modify, update, edit       |
| `help`   | help, assist, support, confused    |
| `yes`    | yes, yeah, yep, sure, ok, confirm  |
| `no`     | no, nope, nah, not, wrong          |

**Determinism rule:** `ON_INPUT` is a _deterministic_ routing primitive. `IF` conditions evaluate as pure boolean expressions over `input` and flow/session variables — no LLM reasoning, no intent classification, no tool calls inside the predicate. If you need LLM-based routing (e.g. "is this user asking to cancel?"), use `DIGRESSIONS` with `INTENT:` instead (see § 3.20.4). Mixing the two is a common source of non-reproducible flows, so the compiler and runtime both treat `ON_INPUT` as a first-match boolean dispatcher.

#### 3.20.4 DIGRESSIONS (Intent-Based Escapes)

Digressions allow users to break out of the current flow based on detected intents:

```dsl
FLOW:
  # Global digressions available in all steps
  global_digressions:
    - INTENT: "cancel"
      RESPOND: "Canceling your request."
      GOTO: cancelled
    - INTENT: "speak_to_agent"
      DELEGATE: Human_Support

  collect_info:
    REASONING: true
    GATHER: destination, checkin, checkout
    # Step-specific digressions
    DIGRESSIONS:
      - INTENT: "help"
        RESPOND: "Just tell me where and when you want to travel."
        RESUME: true              # Return to this step after responding
      - INTENT: "weather"
        DELEGATE: Weather_Agent   # Delegate to another agent
        CLEAR: [destination]      # Clear fields before resuming
        RESUME: true
    THEN: search
```

**Digression Properties:**
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INTENT` | Intent pattern to match |
| `CONDITION` | Optional additional condition |
| `RESPOND` | Response before handling |
| `GOTO` | Target step to go to |
| `DELEGATE` | Agent to delegate to |
| `CALL` | Tool to call |
| `RESUME` | Return to current step (default: false) |
| `CLEAR` | Variables to clear before resuming |

`THEN: COMPLETE` is legal in global and step-level digressions when the digression should terminate the current flow after responding, clearing, delegating, or calling a tool.

Digression intent labels must be unique within a flow. This uniqueness is flow-wide, so a label used in `global_digressions` cannot be reused by a step-level `DIGRESSIONS` block in the same agent.

#### 3.20.5 SUB_INTENTS (Scoped Intents)

Sub-intents are scoped to a specific step and don't leave the step:

```dsl
FLOW:
  select_room:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: "Select a room type."
    SUB_INTENTS:
      - INTENT: "change dates"
        RESPOND: "Let's update your dates."
        CLEAR: [checkin, checkout]
      - INTENT: "more details"
        CALL: get_room_details(hover_room_id)
        RESPOND: "{{result.description}}"
      - INTENT: "price breakdown"
        RESPOND: "{{room.price}} per night, {{total}} total including taxes."
    ON_INPUT:
      - IF: input matches /room\s*\d+/
        SET: selected_room = extracted_room_id
        THEN: confirm
      - ELSE:
        THEN: select_room
```

**Sub-Intent Properties:**
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INTENT` | Intent pattern to match |
| `RESPOND` | Response message |
| `CLEAR` | Variables to clear (triggers re-collection) |
| `SET` | Variables to set |
| `CALL` | Tool to call |
| `RESUME` | Stay in step (default: true for sub-intents) |

#### 3.20.6 ON_SUCCESS / ON_FAIL Blocks

For CALL steps, define separate handling for success and failure:

```dsl
FLOW:
  book_hotel:
    REASONING: false
    CALL: create_reservation(hotel_id, guest_info)
    ON_SUCCESS:
      RESPOND: "Booking confirmed! Reference: {{result.confirmation_id}}"
      THEN: send_confirmation
    ON_FAIL:
      RESPOND: "Sorry, the booking failed: {{result.error}}"
      THEN: retry_or_cancel
```

`THEN:` and `ON_FAIL:` can target either a named step or a terminal action. The terminal keywords `COMPLETE` and `ESCALATE` are case-insensitive.

#### 3.20.7 SET (Variable Assignment)

Assign computed values to variables within flow steps. Supports both inline (single) and block (multiple) forms.

**Inline form (in ON_INPUT branches):**

```dsl
SET: transfer_amount = TO_NUMBER(REPLACE(raw_amount, "$", ""))
```

**Block form (step-level, multiple assignments):**

```dsl
start:
  REASONING: false
  SET:
    preferred_currency = COALESCE(preferred_currency, "USD")
    request_timestamp = NOW()
    transfer_id = UNIQUE_ID(10)
  THEN: next_step
```

Expressions can use any built-in function (see Section 7) and reference session variables or tool result fields via dot notation.

Bare dotted identifiers like `result.user_id` are resolved as value-path expressions. Quote the value explicitly if you need the literal string `"result.user_id"`.

#### 3.20.8 CLEAR (Variable Deletion)

Remove variables from session state. Used to reset state when looping or changing context.

```dsl
CLEAR: from_date, to_date, txnResult, filtered_transactions
```

Commonly used in ON_INPUT branches to reset state before re-collecting:

```dsl
ON_INPUT:
  - IF: input contains "change"
    CLEAR: transfer_amount, raw_amount, limitsResult, feeResult
    THEN: collect_amount
```

#### 3.20.9 CHECK (Inline Condition Guard)

Evaluate an inline boolean condition before continuing to the next step. If the condition is false, the step halts. CHECK is useful for validating prerequisites without a full CONSTRAINT block.

```dsl
verify_balance:
  REASONING: false
  CALL: get_balance
    WITH:
      account_id: selected_account.id
    AS: balanceResult
  CHECK: balanceResult.available >= transfer_amount
  RESPOND: "Balance verified. Proceeding with transfer."
  THEN: confirm_transfer
```

The condition uses the same expression syntax as ON_INPUT `IF:` conditions and CONSTRAINT `REQUIRE` conditions.

#### 3.20.10 CALL WITH/AS (Explicit Tool Parameters and Result Binding)

Enhanced tool calling with explicit parameter mapping (`WITH:`) and result variable binding (`AS:`).

```dsl
fetch_balance:
  REASONING: false
  CALL: get_balance
    WITH:
      account_id: selected_account.id
      currency: preferred_currency
    AS: balanceResult
```

- **WITH** maps named parameters to expressions (variables, dot paths, or built-in function calls)
- **AS** binds the tool result to a named variable for subsequent use in ON_RESULT branches or SET expressions

Function-style `CALL:` syntax normalizes the lookup key to the bare tool name. For example, `CALL: check_outage_by_address(service_address)` resolves the registered tool `check_outage_by_address`.

#### 3.20.11 ON_RESULT (Multi-Way Result Branching)

Branch on tool call results with multiple conditions. Replaces the simpler ON_SUCCESS/ON_FAIL pattern when more than two outcomes are possible.

```dsl
validate_recipient_step:
  REASONING: false
  CALL: validate_recipient
    WITH:
      routing_number: recipient_routing
      account_number: recipient_account
    AS: recipientResult
  ON_RESULT:
    - IF: recipientResult.status == "valid"
      SET:
        recipient_bank = recipientResult.bank_name
        recipient_name = recipientResult.account_holder
      THEN: collect_amount
    - IF: recipientResult.status == "INVALID_ROUTING"
      RESPOND: "The routing number is invalid. Please double-check."
      THEN: collect_recipient
    - IF: recipientResult.status == "ACCOUNT_CLOSED"
      RESPOND: "That account appears to be closed."
      THEN: collect_recipient
    - ELSE:
      RESPOND: "We couldn't verify the recipient details."
      THEN: collect_recipient
```

ON_RESULT branches support the same properties as ON_INPUT branches: `IF`/`ELSE`, `SET`, `CLEAR`, `RESPOND`, and `THEN`.

Evaluation is first-match in author order. If no ON_RESULT branch matches and the tool call itself succeeded, the runtime falls through to `ON_SUCCESS` when present; if the tool call failed, it falls through to `ON_FAIL`. Use a final `ELSE` branch when you want to own every successful result shape and avoid fallback handling.

#### 3.20.12 TRANSFORM (Array Data Pipeline)

Process arrays through a declarative pipeline with filter, map, sort, and limit operations.

```dsl
apply_filters:
  REASONING: false
  TRANSFORM: txnResult.transactions AS txn INTO filtered_transactions
    FILTER: filter_type == "all" OR txn.type == filter_type
    MAP:
      id: txn.id
      date: FORMAT_DATE(txn.date, "MMM DD")
      description: COALESCE(txn.merchant, txn.description)
      display_amount: FORMAT_CURRENCY(ABS(txn.amount), "USD")
      direction: UPPER(SUBSTRING(txn.type, 0, 1))
      category: UPPER(txn.category)
    SORT_BY: date DESC
    LIMIT: page_size
  THEN: display_transactions
```

**Pipeline stages:**

- `FILTER:` — Boolean expression; items where the condition is true are kept
- `MAP:` — Object with field mappings; each value is an expression evaluated per item
- `SORT_BY:` — Field name with optional `ASC`/`DESC` direction (default: ASC)
- `LIMIT:` — Maximum number of items to keep (expression or literal)

All stages are optional. MAP expressions can use any built-in function and reference the item variable (`txn` in the example above) via dot notation.

### 3.21 Execution Pipeline (Supervisor Pre-Classification)

Supervisors can enable an opt-in classification pipeline that runs before the main reasoning LLM. A smaller, faster model classifies user intent and optionally short-circuits routing — avoiding the cost of the full reasoning call for obvious routing decisions.

#### Configuration

```dsl
SUPERVISOR: Support_Router
  EXECUTION:
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
    pipeline:
      enabled: true
      mode: sequential          # 'parallel' | 'sequential'
      model: qwen3-30b          # Smaller/faster classifier model
      shortCircuit:
        enabled: true
        confidenceThreshold: 0.85
      toolFilter:
        enabled: true
        maxTools: 6
      keywordVeto:
        enabled: true
        keywords: [reset, cancel, undo]

  HANDOFF:
    - TO: Billing_Agent
      WHEN: intent.category == "billing"
    - TO: Tech_Support
      WHEN: intent.category == "technical_support"
    - TO: General_Inquiry
      WHEN: true
```

#### Pipeline Options

| Option                             | Default     | Description                                                                                                            |

| `mode`                             | `parallel`  | `parallel` — classifier and main LLM run simultaneously; `sequential` — classifier runs first, main LLM only if needed |
| `model`                            | `qwen3-30b` | Model for classification (should be fast/cheap)                                                                        |
| `shortCircuit.enabled`             | `true`      | Allow direct routing when classifier confidence is high                                                                |
| `shortCircuit.confidenceThreshold` | `0.85`      | Minimum confidence to skip the reasoning loop                                                                          |
| `toolFilter.enabled`               | `true`      | Filter tools to only relevant ones before reasoning                                                                    |
| `toolFilter.maxTools`              | `6`         | Maximum tools to pass to the reasoning loop                                                                            |
| `keywordVeto.enabled`              | `true`      | Prevent short-circuit when user mentions local tool keywords                                                           |
| `keywordVeto.keywords`             | `[]`        | Additional keywords that veto short-circuit routing                                                                    |

#### Execution Flow

```

    ↓

    ↓ yes                     ↓ no

HANDOFF (skip reasoning)
```

#### Configuration Resolution

Pipeline config resolves through a 3-level hierarchy:

1. **Agent IR** (`execution.pipeline` block) — highest priority
2. **Project config** — project-level defaults
3. **System defaults** — hardcoded fallback values

#### Sequential vs Parallel Mode

- **Sequential**: Classifier runs first. If it short-circuits, the main LLM is never called — saving the full cost of a reasoning iteration. Best for supervisors where most messages route cleanly.
- **Parallel**: Classifier and main LLM run simultaneously. Short-circuit still works, but if it doesn't fire, the classifier only contributes tool filtering. You pay for both calls regardless.

> **Cost note**: For pure routing supervisors, `sequential` mode with `shortCircuit.enabled: true` provides the best cost savings. In `parallel` mode, the classifier adds latency protection but no cost savings.

## 4. Compilation to AgentIR

### 4.1 Compilation Pipeline

ABL source files are compiled to a typed intermediate representation (`AgentIR`) at deploy time. The runtime loads and executes the IR directly — there is no code generation step.

```
ABL Source (.agent.abl or .agent.yaml)
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   Parser (@abl/core)     │
│   parseAgentBasedDSL()   │
│   → AgentBasedDocument   │
└──────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Compiler (@abl/compiler)│
│  compileDSLtoIR()        │
│  → CompilationOutput     │
│    { agents, entry_agent }│
└──────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   Runtime Executors      │
│  (apps/runtime/src/      │
│   services/execution/)   │
│  • ReasoningExecutor     │
│  • FlowStepExecutor      │
│  • RoutingExecutor       │
│  • ConstraintChecker     │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

The only compilation target is `'ir'`. The compiler produces a `CompilationOutput` containing a map of `AgentIR` instances (one per agent, including supervisors) and identifies the entry agent.

### 4.2 Generated IR Structure

For the `Hotel_Search` agent example, the compiler produces an `AgentIR` with:

- **identity**: Built from GOAL, PERSONA, LIMITATIONS — includes a generated `system_prompt.template`
- **tools**: `ToolDefinition[]` from the TOOLS section, with typed parameters, return schemas, and optional auth fields (`auth_profile_ref`, `jit_auth`, `consent_mode`, `connection_mode`). Auth requirements are collected post-compilation into `AuthRequirementIR[]` for preflight consent and credential resolution
- **gather**: `GatherConfig` with field definitions from the GATHER section
- **constraints**: `ConstraintConfig` with a flattened ordered constraint list plus guardrails from CONSTRAINTS
- **coordination**: `CoordinationConfig` with handoffs, delegates, escalation from HANDOFF/DELEGATE/ESCALATE
- **completion**: `CompletionConfig` from COMPLETE conditions
- **memory**: `MemoryConfig` from MEMORY section (session variables, persistent paths, remember triggers, recall instructions)

At runtime, the executor loads the IR, builds the system prompt, wires tools to the LLM provider, and manages the conversation loop. Constraint checking, tool execution, handoff/delegate routing, and escalation are handled by dedicated executor modules in the runtime.

## 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration

### 5.1 Supervisor for Agent-Based Agents (Unified AgentIR)

When using multiple agent-based agents, a supervisor coordinates them. Supervisors compile to the same `AgentIR` type as regular agents — they are simply agents with `routing` and `available_agents` fields populated. All agents (including supervisors) live in a single `CompilationOutput.agents` registry. Supervisors can hand off to other supervisors, enabling hierarchical composition:

```
SUPERVISOR: Travel_Assistant

GOAL: "Route customer requests to the appropriate specialist agent"

HANDOFF:
  - TO: Hotel_Search
    WHEN: user.intent == "hotel" OR user.intent == "accommodation"
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [user.preferences, user.loyalty_programs]

  - TO: Flight_Search
    WHEN: user.intent == "flight"

  - TO: Payment_Agent
    WHEN: reservation.ready_for_payment
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [reservation, user.loyalty_programs]

  - TO: Support_Agent
    WHEN: user.requests_human OR user.sentiment == "frustrated"
    CONTEXT:
      pass: [conversation_history, active_agent]
```

| `result`                            | `object`  | Current tool or step result in contexts that bind a result.                 |
| `always`                            | `boolean` | Built-in truthy sentinel for unconditional conditions.                      |
| `_constraint_checkpoint_kind`       | `string`  | Internal checkpoint kind while evaluating checkpointed constraints.         |

| `previous_system_message_was_offer` | `boolean` | Runtime conversational state used by offer/continuation heuristics.         |

Use these canonical snake_case variables when the runtime owns the value. Dotted `user.*` paths are profile/session metadata supplied by the host channel or application, not guaranteed runtime-assigned variables.

#### Pattern Match Variable

| Variable | Assigned By                         | Contents                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `match`  | `matches` operator in IF conditions | Regex capture groups: `match.0` (full match), `match.1` (first group), `match.room_id` (named group) |

> **Warning:** If you use `SET: match = value`, the variable will be overwritten by the next successful `matches` operation. The compiler emits a warning for reserved variable names.

#### Gather & Extraction Variables

| Variable               | Type                     | Set When                                | Description                                         |

| `_clarification_count` | `number`                 | Session init (0), incremented on re-ask | How many times the agent re-prompted for a field    |
| `_validation_retries`  | `Record<string, number>` | Validation failure                      | Per-field count of failed validation attempts       |
| `_pending_inferences`  | `object`                 | LLM infers a field value                | Inferred values waiting for user confirmation       |
| `all_fields_gathered`  | `boolean`                | All required GATHER fields collected    | True when gather is complete — use in COMPLETE/WHEN |

```dsl
COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: all_fields_gathered == true
    RESPOND: "Great, I have everything I need."
```

#### Tool Result Variables

| Variable                  | Type     | Set When             | Description                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `last_<tool_name>_result` | `object` | After tool execution | Full result of the most recent call to the named tool |

```dsl
CONSTRAINTS:
  always:
    - REQUIRE last_search_hotels_result.total > 0
      ON_FAIL: "No hotels found matching your criteria. Try different dates?"
```

#### Intent & Sentiment Variables

| Variable               | Type     | Set When                                   | Legal Values                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user.intent`          | `string` | Intent classification on each user message | Agent-specific (detected by NLU)                                                  |
| `user.sentiment`       | `string` | Sentiment analysis on each user message    | `very_negative`, `negative`, `neutral`, `positive`, `very_positive`, `frustrated` |
| `sentiment_trajectory` | `string` | Computed across conversation turns         | `improving`, `declining`, `stable`, `volatile`                                    |

```dsl
ESCALATE:
  triggers:
    - WHEN: user.sentiment == "very_negative" AND sentiment_trajectory == "declining"
      REASON: "User frustration detected"
      PRIORITY: high
  context_for_human:
    - conversation_history
    - user.sentiment
```

#### Constraint & Error Variables

| Variable                  | Type       | Set When                                | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `_constraint_warnings`    | `string[]` | Constraint evaluation produces warnings | Warning messages from soft constraint failures |
| `tool_failures`           | `number`   | Tool execution fails                    | Count of consecutive tool failures             |
| `constraint_failures`     | `number`   | Constraint check fails                  | Count of constraint violations                 |
| `_disambiguation_intents` | `string[]` | Multi-intent detection                  | Possible intents when disambiguation needed    |

#### Session & Channel Variables

| Variable   | Type     | Set When              | Legal Values / Description                          |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

  - TO: Spanish_Support
    WHEN: language == "es"
  - TO: General_Support
    WHEN: channel == "voice"
    PASS: [user_id, sentiment_trajectory]
```

Automatic handoff metadata propagation excludes values that were gathered from user input on the parent thread. Use `PASS` when a gathered value must be forwarded explicitly to the child agent.

#### Orchestration Variables

| Variable             | Type      | Set When                            | Description                           |

| `handoff.completed`  | `boolean` | Child agent completes after handoff | True when a handed-off agent finishes |
| `escalate.completed` | `boolean` | Human agent resolves escalation     | True when escalation is resolved      |

```dsl
COMPLETE:
  - WHEN: handoff.completed == true
    RESPOND: "Is there anything else I can help with?"
```

#### Reserved Variable Prefixes

Variables beginning with `_` are reserved for runtime use. The following prefixes have special meaning:

| Prefix                    | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_summary`                | Conversation summary state                                   |
| `_stored_*`               | Persistent memory values                                     |
| `_error`                  | Error state from last failed operation                       |
| `_correction`             | Correction detection state                                   |
| `_current_step_for_reset` | Flow step tracking (resets validation counts on step change) |

### 7.9 MASK Patterns

Built-in patterns for the `MASK()` function:

| Pattern  | Behavior                      | Example                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `last4`  | Show only last 4 characters   | `MASK("4111111111111111", "last4")` → `"************1111"`  |
| `first4` | Show only first 4 characters  | `MASK("4111111111111111", "first4")` → `"4111************"` |
| `N*N`    | Show N chars at start and end | `MASK("4111111111111111", "4*4")` → `"4111********1111"`    |

Pattern names are string literals passed as the second argument to `MASK()`, not variable references.

### 7.10 Events & Lifecycle Hooks

ABL supports lifecycle events for triggering actions at specific execution points.

#### RECALL Events

Used in the MEMORY section to trigger recall of stored information:

| Event Pattern              | Fires When                        | Example                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `session:start`            | New session begins                | Load user preferences          |
| `session:end`              | Session terminates                | Save conversation summary      |
| `agent:<name>:before`      | Before a specific agent starts    | `agent:Payment_Agent:before`   |
| `agent:<name>:after`       | After a specific agent completes  | `agent:Billing_Agent:after`    |
| `agent:*:before`           | Before any agent starts           | Global pre-agent hook          |
| `agent:*:after`            | After any agent completes         | Global post-agent hook         |
| `tool:<name>:after`        | After a specific tool executes    | `tool:search_hotels:after`     |
| `tool:*:after`             | After any tool executes           | Global post-tool hook          |
| `entity:<field>:extracted` | After a gather field is extracted | `entity:destination:extracted` |
| `step:enter:<name>`        | When a flow step is entered       | `step:enter:Collect_Payment`   |
| `step:exit:<name>`         | When a flow step is exited        | `step:exit:Verify_Identity`    |

```dsl
MEMORY:
  recall:
    - ON: session:start
      ACTION: inject_context
      PATHS: [user.preferences, user.loyalty_tier]
    - ON: tool:search_hotels:after
      ACTION: inject_context
      PATHS: [user.hotel_preferences]
    - ON: entity:destination:extracted
      ACTION: inject_context
      PATHS: [user.destination_history]
```

| Field         | Required | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ON`          | yes      | Canonical event name.                                                                     |
| `ACTION`      | yes      | Recall behavior: `inject_context`, `load_memory`, or `prompt_llm`.                        |
| `PATHS`       | no       | Memory paths to load and inject.                                                          |
| `DOMAIN`      | no       | Optional memory domain for domain-scoped `load_memory` rules.                             |
| `INSTRUCTION` | no       | Natural-language instruction for `prompt_llm`; use when the LLM should interpret context. |

> **Legacy syntax**: retired `ON_<event>:` aliases (for example, `ON_SESSION_START:` or `session_start`) now fail with guided diagnostics. Use canonical events such as `ON: session:start`, `ON: agent:*:after`, or `ON: tool:<name>:after`.
>
> `tool:<name>:before` and `tool:*:before` are intentionally unsupported. RECALL can mutate context used during tool dispatch, so tool hooks are limited to post-dispatch `:after` events.

#### Lifecycle Hooks

Hooks execute actions at agent and conversation turn boundaries:

| Hook           | Fires When                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `before_agent` | Before the agent begins processing (session init) |
| `after_agent`  | After the agent completes                         |
| `before_turn`  | Before each conversation turn is processed        |
| `after_turn`   | After each conversation turn completes            |

```dsl
HOOKS:
  before_turn:
    CALL: audit_logger
    SET:
      _turn_start: NOW()
  after_turn:
    CALL: metrics_reporter
    RESPOND: ""  # Silent — no user-facing message
```

#### Flow Step Events (ON_SUCCESS / ON_FAIL / ON_RESULT / ON_INPUT)

These events are documented in Section 3.20.6 (ON_SUCCESS/ON_FAIL), 3.20.11 (ON_RESULT), and 3.20.3 (ON_INPUT). They fire at specific points within a flow step:

| Event        | Fires When                                       | Use For                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `ON_SUCCESS` | Step's CALL or GATHER completes successfully     | Happy-path branching              |
| `ON_FAIL`    | Step's CALL or GATHER fails                      | Error recovery, retry, escalation |
| `ON_RESULT`  | After CALL returns — multi-way branch on result  | Route based on tool return values |
| `ON_INPUT`   | After user input — conditional branch on content | Deterministic routing by response |

> **Evaluation order**: ON_INPUT is evaluated on a frozen state snapshot. Mutations (SET, TRANSITION) are collected and applied after all conditions are evaluated. This prevents side effects from affecting sibling branches.

> **Determinism**: ON_INPUT `IF:` predicates are pure boolean expressions over `input` and session/flow variables. No LLM reasoning, no tool invocations, no intent classification runs inside the predicate — if you need LLM-based routing, use `DIGRESSIONS` with `INTENT:` (§ 3.20.4). Treat ON_INPUT as a first-match boolean dispatcher so replays and eval snapshots are reproducible.

### 7.11 Runtime Defaults & Limits

The following defaults apply when not overridden in the agent's EXECUTION block or project configuration:

#### Timeouts

## 8. Common Pitfalls

These are validated issues discovered through real-world agent development and parser/compiler testing:

### 8.1 Behavior Profiles Must Be Standalone Files

**Wrong** — inline `BEHAVIOR_PROFILE:` inside an agent:

```
AGENT: My_Agent
GOAL: "Help users"

BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: voice-optimized    # ← DESTROYS the agent document!
  WHEN: context.channel == "voice"
  INSTRUCTIONS: "Be concise"
```

The parser treats `BEHAVIOR_PROFILE:` as a document-type keyword. When encountered inside an `AGENT:` document, it **silently overwrites the document kind** from `agent` to `behavior_profile` and consumes all remaining content. The agent compiles with zero errors but resolves as a behavior profile — not an agent.

**Correct** — separate file with `USE` reference:

```
# voice-optimized.behavior_profile.abl
BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: voice-optimized
WHEN: context.channel == "voice"
INSTRUCTIONS: "Be concise"
```

```
# my_agent.agent.abl
AGENT: My_Agent
GOAL: "Help users"
USE BEHAVIOR_PROFILE: voice-optimized
```

### 8.2 BEHAVIOR_PROFILES (Plural) Is Not Supported

The plural form `BEHAVIOR_PROFILES:` produces an "Unknown section" parser error. Only the singular `BEHAVIOR_PROFILE:` is recognized as a document-type keyword.

### 8.3 Tools Must Exist in Tool Library Before Compilation

Tools referenced by agents must exist in the project's tool registry by compile/runtime time. The normal authoring paths are:

- create them explicitly in the Tool Library / tools API
- import companion `.tools.abl` files with the project bundle
- import a project bundle whose inline agent `TOOLS:` signatures auto-create project tool stubs during apply

If none of those provisioning paths creates the tool, the compiler validates tool names against the project's registry and emits `E721: Tool <name> not found in project`.

Before deploying an agent, create all tools via the API:

```
POST /api/projects/:projectId/tools
{ "name": "lookup_customer", "description": "Look up customer by phone", ... }
```

### 8.4 ESCALATE PRIORITY Uses Strings

Use string values for ESCALATE priority.

**ESCALATE** — string values: `critical`, `high`, `medium` (default), `low`:

```
ESCALATE:
  triggers:
    - WHEN: user.requests_human
      REASON: "User requested human"
      PRIORITY: high            # ← String values: critical, high, medium, low
```

### 8.5 ESCALATE Inside ON_ERROR Is Silently Dropped

`ESCALATE: PRIORITY: <value>` inside ON_ERROR handlers is **not parsed**. Use `THEN: ESCALATE with REASON:` instead:

**Wrong:**

```
ON_ERROR:
  unknown_error:
    RESPOND: "Something went wrong."
    ESCALATE: PRIORITY: high    # ← Silently dropped
```

**Correct:**

```
ON_ERROR:
  unknown_error:
    RESPOND: "Something went wrong."
    RETRY: 0
    THEN: ESCALATE with REASON: "Unexpected error"
```

### 8.6 Template Voice Instructions Follow Template Resolution

`VOICE INSTRUCTIONS:` on a named template is applied when a supported `TEMPLATE(<name>)` reference is resolved. The referenced response or prompt receives `voice_config.instructions` unless it already has an explicit nested `VOICE:` block, in which case the local `VOICE:` block wins.

### 8.7 Import Requires project.json

The import API (`POST /api/projects/:id/import/apply`) requires a `project.json` file in the payload. Without it, the import fails with `MISSING_MANIFEST`.

Locale assets must also use canonical paths of the form `locales/<locale>/<file>.json`. Paths such as `locales/en.json` or `locales/*.json` are rejected during preview with `E_LOCALE_INVALID_PATH` instead of surfacing a later opaque apply failure.

### 8.8 Uppercase Keywords Are Required for Legacy Format

The `.agent.abl` format (legacy/uppercase) requires uppercase keywords: `AGENT:`, `GOAL:`, `TOOLS:`, `GATHER:`, etc. Lowercase keywords (`agent:`, `goal:`) are only valid in the YAML format (`.agent.yaml`). Mixed case is not supported.

### 8.9 FLOW Steps Require REASONING Declaration

Every FLOW step MUST declare `REASONING: true` or `REASONING: false`. Without this, the parser produces an error:

```
Step 'step_name' must declare REASONING: true or REASONING: false.
```

**Wrong:**

```
FLOW:
  greeting:
    RESPOND: "Hello!"       # ← Error: no REASONING declaration
    THEN: next
```

**Correct:**

```
FLOW:
  greeting:
    REASONING: false
    RESPOND: "Hello!"
    THEN: next
```

Use `REASONING: true` when the step should allow the LLM to reason about what to do next. Use `REASONING: false` for deterministic steps that follow a fixed script.

### 8.10 TEMPLATE References Must Match Defined Templates

When using `RESPOND: TEMPLATE(<name>)` in COMPLETE or other sections, the referenced template name must be defined in the `TEMPLATES:` section. Missing template references produce `E601: Undefined template "<name>" referenced` at compile time.

## 9. Appendix: Type Definitions

### 9.1 Built-in Types

```typescript
type string = string;
type number = number;
type boolean = boolean;
type date = string; // ISO 8601 or natural language
type array = any[];
type object = Record<string, any>;
```

### 9.2 Domain Types (Examples)

```typescript
interface Hotel {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  chain?: string;
  rating: number;
  price_per_night: number;
  amenities: string[];
  location: string;
}

interface HotelDetails extends Hotel {
  description: string;
  rooms_available: number;
  room_types: RoomType[];
  cancellation_policy: string;
  images: string[];
}

interface Reservation {
  id: string;
  confirmation_number: string;
  hotel: Hotel;
  room_type: string;
  checkin: date;
  checkout: date;
  guests: number;
  total: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled';
}

interface GuestInfo {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone?: string;
  loyalty_number?: string;
}
```
